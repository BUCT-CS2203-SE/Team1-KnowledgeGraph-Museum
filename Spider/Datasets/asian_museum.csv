The style of this robe suggests that it was worn by a Han Chinese woman rather than a Manchu woman: the wide sleeves cut all in one with the body of the robe along a central seam and the neckline with a stand-up collar are common details for native Chinese dress. The robe would have also been paired with a pleated skirt—a traditional outfit for Han Chinese women. The body of this robe is silk damask with a woven design of the attributes of the Eight Taoist Immortals: fan, gourd and iron crutch, fish drum, lotus, basket of flowers or peaches, sword and fly whisk, pair of beaters for keeping time, and flute. The white satin trim along the hem and the ""cloud collar"" is embroidered with depictions of women engaged in various virtuous pursuits such as the Four Scholarly Pursuits ( siyi ): playing the qin musical instrument, playing chess, reading, and painting. The cloud collar ( yunjian ) is the four-pointed scrolled motif covering the neckline and shoulder of the robe. Resembling the heads of the ruyi wish-granting wand, the cloud collar symbolizes the blessing of ""may all your wishes come true"" ( shishi ruyi ).",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/66756/preview,"H. 39 3/4 in x W. 61 1/2 in, H. 100.1 cm x W. 156.2 cm",,,1988.32.30,China,,,,Chinese woman's formal domestic short coat

Introduced to the Qing court by Europeans in the late 1600s, snuff taking became an imperial habit, and many bottles were produced for the court. Besides clearing one’s sinuses, snuff was also believed to relieve headaches, and by the early nineteenth century its inhalation had become a widespread practice in China. Early examples were simple in form, but by the late 1700s medicinal bottles had evolved into beautiful works of art that were viewed as collectors’ items. The appeal of these bottles to collectors continues to this day. Snuff bottles are a reflection of Chinese art in miniature form. They are especially rich in Chinese symbols because, as objects carried on one’s person, they reflect the sentiments of their owners. Their decorations frequently symbolize the owner’s wishes for blessings, numerous offspring, wealth and rank, and longevity.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/7762/preview,H. 3 1/2 in,,,2006.19,China,,,,Snuff bottle in the shape of a Chinese cabbage

images/asian_chinese74.jpg,Gift of Haji Noor Deen,,Ink on paper,"Mi Guangjiang (Haji Noor Deen) (Chinese, b. 1963)",,,Not on view,Chinese Art,,2005,,Painting,,,,"Islam has a long history in China, and Chinese Muslims have played significant roles in a number of activities, particularly finance and trade. Perhaps the most famous Muslim in Chinese history is the great Ming dynasty admiral and explorer Zheng He, who led a Chinese fleet through Southeast Asia, around India, and along the east coast of Africa in the early 1400s. For centuries after, Chinese Muslims found that their knowledge of both Chinese and Arabic gave them an advantage along the vast trade routes where these two languages were widely used for business dealings. The artist of this work, Haji Noor Deen (Mi Guangjiang), is a Chinese Muslim who is trained in the art of Arabic calligraphy. His calligraphy works are an unusual combination of the Arabic and Chinese calligraphic traditions, highlighting issues of identity and diversity in China. The artist, as translated by Rashid Patch, provides this explanation of the calligraphy: The large Chinese character means ""peace."" The shape of the Chinese also forms the Arabic lettering as-salaam (""peace""), written vertically in highly stylized ""sini"" style Arabic script. So, the piece is a hybrid, reading ""peace"" simultaneously in Chinese and Arabic script. In the upper section of the calligraphy, the top panel is also in sini style Arabic letters (though very highly stylized) reading ""In the Name of God, Most Merciful, Most Compassionate."" The sini style of Arabic lettering was developed in China (sini means ""Chinese"" in Arabic), and although it has a thirteen-century-long history of development, it is not well known to Muslims outside of East Asia. It often employs a brush rather than the reed pen used in most Arabic calligraphy. The letter forms tend to vary in thickness far more than the other major Arabic script styles, and often have an almost liquid character. Sini script is frequently written (and read) vertically, like Chinese script, as well as in the usual Arabic right-to-left pattern. Forms and graphic motifs from traditional Chinese calligraphy and art are often incorporated into sini Arabic, enriching the script. The Arabic letters in this section form the shape of crossed spears in a weapons rack, a traditional display in martial arts schools and a common design motif in Chinese graphics. If the spear tips were pointed straight up, it would express wariness, potential hostility, trouble, or war. With the spear points crossed over each other, the image expresses peace, the end of hostilities, and security.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/6026/preview,"H. 35 3/4 in x W. 20 3/4 in, H. 90.8 cm x W. 36.2 cm (image); H. 54 1/4 in x W. 20 3/4 in, H. 137.8 cm x W. 52.7 cm (overall)",,,2005.94,,,,,Calligraphy

The semi-abstract picture not only encapsulates the charm of Chinese classical gardens but also reflects the artist’s idea that painting from nature is “not merely sketching shapes but perceiving forms. . . The main point is to bring out a sense of life.” Wu highlights the rhythmic beauty of curved rooflines extending out into the distance, with black tiles dancing across a white background. At the central courtyard, a blossoming wisteria tree adds spots of blue, representing “the vigor of spring’s radiance.” Wu was one of the most influential Chinese artists of his generation. He studied Chinese and Western painting under Pan Tianshou (1897–1971) and Lin Fengmian (1900–1991) at the Hangzhou Art Academy in the late 1930s and early 1940s. In 1947, Wu followed in Lin’s footsteps, receiving a government grant to study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he became fascinated with modernist artistic currents. He returned to China brimming with enthusiasm for Western art, especially the works of the Post-Impressionists, and advocated for the modernization of Chinese painting. During the Cultural Revolution, Wu was sent to labor and re-education camps and his paintings were destroyed. But he returned to prolific art-making in the late 1970s, and traveled frequently to depict the scenes of old water towns and classical gardens in Jiangnan. He also openly advocated for the beauty of abstraction and color and stayed active as both a painter and a theorist until his death at age 90.

Mingde. 1989. Even after the devastating years of the Cultural Revolution (1966û1976), Chinese artists have continued to portray traditional symbols of good fortune and happiness. Zhang MingdeÆs title for this work refers to his intent to depict a rooster since according to traditional Chinese belief, this animal is a symbol of yang (the masculine) in the yin and yang dichotomy. The Chinese term for a rooster crowing is a homonym for ôsuccess and fame.ö The rooster can ward off evil, including devouring the Five Noxious Creatures (the centipede, the scorpion, the snake, the toad, and the spider or salamander). The rooster has five virtues: It has civil culture because it wears a crown; it is a warrior because its spurs are forceful; it is brave because it confronts its enemies; it is benevolent because it communicates when it finds food; it is trustworthy because it tells the correct time through the night. In this painting the rooster is paired with a red flowering plum; the call of the rooster, which symbolizes the sun, ushers in a new day, while the plum is a sign of spring and the renewal of life. ZhangÆs style recalls the works of the great modern painter Qi Baishi (1863û1957), who drew inspiration from folk art and excelled in depicting objects from everyday life. In fact ZhangÆs teacher Li Kuchan studied Chinese painting under Qi. Li advocated the integration of calligraphic techniques into painting. The color and ink in this work are bright and dense.

A little background on the medium: Lacquer is made of the sap of a member of the rhus family, which also contains poison ivy and poison sumac. The sap contains a very high level of urushiol, the chemical in these plants that causes dermatitis on contact. Raw lacquer is a thick liquid that can be applied as paint or used as a resin, much like the resin for fiberglass. Under the right conditions, it will undergo a chemical change that creates a substance not unlike modern plastic. It is very durable and can withstand exposure to heat and liquids. Urushiol in its raw state is very caustic and only a limited number of stable materials can be used as pigments. For much of the history of lacquer in China these pigments were browns and blacks derived from carbon, and red from cinnabar. Traditionally the primary centers of lacquer production in China have been along the Yangtze River. Lacquered objects dating from as early as 3000 BCE have been found in archaeological sites in this region; the lacquer has survived in remarkably good condition-the issue is with the cores, which are most often made of wood. Over thousands of years of burial, water invariably penetrates the wood cores which swell and then shrink when they dry. That is the explanation for the wrinkled surface on this piece. In its original form it would have been smooth and shiny with very clearly demarcated designs. The level of workmanship for this piece is remarkable. The basic core consists of a circular wood base with six very thin and slightly curved pieces of wood making up the walls. The pieces of wood do not appear to have been joined in any way, though it is likely they were glued together, perhaps with lacquer. The wood is covered both inside and out with a single layer of textile. Either the fabric was impregnated with lacquer before it was applied or lacquer was applied directly to it to create a strong and durable object. Close examination indicates an additional layer of lacquer was applied as a filler to smooth out the imperfections in the surface before the finish coats were applied. The finish coats are in black with designs added in red and brown. The interior of the vessel is red. The three ears on the lid, the handle and the base with three attached legs are cast bronze. Again, there is no clear evidence of mechanical attachments like nails, instead it appears the lacquer serves as an adhesive holding these appendages to the lacquered wood body; there are two holes in each end of the bronze handle, with a groove between them, suggesting that it was tied or wired to something. There is no original lacquer around the handle, so we really don't know for certain if it is even original to this object, though the inlaid decoration matches the other fittings. The elaborate designs on the bronze appear to have been incised and then inlaid with silver. They relate closely to the designs painted in red on the black lacquer surface. By the time this piece was created, lacquered objects were far more expensive than bronze; vessels like this one were objects of prestige. During the Eastern Zhou dynasty Chu, which occupied the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, was the state best known for lacquer production. A 1956 publication in Chinese indicates that this piece was excavated in Changsha in Hunan province, one of the major centers of Chu culture. Included in the red lacquer decoration on the lid of this vessel are two designs which can be read as the Chinese character chang (檉's mark. An inscription is incised on the bottom and with it the story of this remarkable piece gets much more complex and challenging. Incising or carving decoration into lacquer objects was just beginning to appear as a decorative strategy in the late Warring States period and the Qin dynasty. In fact, this could be the earliest incised inscription with a date on any surviving Chinese lacquer. The inscription starts with a date: the twenty ninth year, and goes on to state that a dowager queen (tai hou太后 A Chinese scholar has suggested the queen mentioned in the inscription might be the dowager queen Xuan (died 265 BCE) who was a native Chu and mother of King Zhao of Qin who died in 251BCE. If so, the date of the piece would be 278 BCE, making it the earliest surviving example of a Chinese lacquer with a date. Unfortunately, the date does not contain the ruler's name, just the twenty-ninth year. That leaves the actual date open to conjecture; there are several issues with the 278 BCE date. Qin was not a center of lacquer production until its conquest of Chu territories in 278 BCE. The areas conquered included the Chu capital of Ying, located near the modern city of Jiangling in Hubei province. No doubt centers of lacquer production were also included in the conquered areas. It is possible that the vessel could be spoils of war but that would not explain the style of the calligraphy used in the inscription, the association with a Qin queen, or the fact that it was reported excavated from a tomb in Changsha, which in 278 BCE was still in Chu territory. It seems highly unlikely that the Qin would have been able to put into place the level of bureaucracy suggested in the inscription in the same year they made these conquests. The piece might have been the property of the dowager queen brought Qin as part of her dowry. Again, that does not explain the style of the calligraphy. Also, there is no evidence in existing Chu documents of the complex bureaucracy associated with the creation of lacquers suggested by the inscription. This is far more typical of the state of Qin. Also, makers' marks are very rare on Chu state lacquers. I do not know of any. The more likely explanation is the date is not the twenty ninth year of King X, but rather the 29th year of the reign of the First Emperor himself. That would be equivalent to 218 BCE. Such a date would explain all the issues raised above. The problem with this date is the Shiji states that the First Emperor's mother died in the 17th year of his reign. That is equivalent to 230 BCE. An explanation might be found in the reading of the fourth and fifth characters of the inscription. As mentioned above this has been read as tai hou (太后大司",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/73504/preview,Overall: H. 7 in × W. 4 7/8 in × D. 6 3/8 in (17.8 cm × 12.4 cm × 16.2 cm),,,B60M286.a-.b,China,Warring States period (approx. 475-221 BCE),Chu culture,,Lidded vessel with design of clouds and phoenixes

There is substantial evidence for the importance of Islamic art at his court. The success of Zheng He's exploration (see cat. no. 65) further encouraged the emperor's hopes of a rapprochement with other parts of the world. Foreign envoys who returned with Zheng He, bearing various tributes, particularly amazed the Yongle emperor. To better fulfill China's diplomatic missions, as well as to reap the benefits of trade, myriad Chinese products were prepared for Zheng He's fleets. The most valuable good that China could produce in mass quantities during this era was porcelain. A 1988 excavation by archaeologists found ruin strata of early Ming-dynasty official kilns in Jingdezhen. Remains of large porcelain plates, bowls, and jars discovered in the Yongle-period stratum are now known to have been created as exports for Islamic markets. Never in the history of Chinese ceramic manufacture had as many foreigninspired forms taken shape as in the Yongle emperor's factories. Certain forms among these were even adopted for use in the imperial palaces and temples. One statistic suggests that nine out of twenty-one whiteglazed ceremonial types have forms originatingin Islamic metalwork (Urban Council et al. 1989, pp. 22 – 23, pl. 1, 4 – 6, 8 – 9, 11, 13, 22). Three of those nine types are represented by this group of water utensils from the Asian Art Museum collection, demonstrating the Yongle emperor's preference for the Islamic style. They share similarities in their precise potting, refined clay, and smooth glaze without air bubbles. Decorations were rendered in quality materials with precious cobalt imported from the Islamic world, producing distinctive color and luster. Painted on the clay body, the cobalt, with its high iron and low magnesium content, turned to dark blue through glazing and firing, with irregular ferruginous strains where it had curdled. The decorative subjects on these three works combine motifs from different sources: the Chinese traditional meander and flowers, stylized arabesques of Islamic influence, and the Buddhist Eight Treasures and essential lotus.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/16211/preview,"H. 5 1/2 in x Diam. 12 1/4 in, H. 14 cm x Diam. 31.1 cm",,,B60P33+,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",,,,Buddhist ablution basin with Eight Treasures

Some areas, such as the islands of Indonesia, did not have large-scale ceramics industries of their own. Others, such as Japan, Persia, and Siam (now known as Thailand), had such industries but still wanted Chinese wares, some of which were technically superior to most of their locally made wares. In the seventeenth century, Chinese workshops produced blue-and-white dishes and vessels decorated in the Japanese style for export to Japan. These were popular among practitioners of the tea ceremony, and came to be known by the Japanese as kosometsuke, meaning ""old blue-and-white wares."" Merchants and suppliers learned early on that they could sell more of their products by customizing them for the needs and tastes of various foreign markets.

This date is about four hundred years after Buddhism was introduced from India to China. Originally from an altar shrine, this Buddha statue was once seated on a platform and adorned with a canopy and two halos. It is among the largest bronze sculptures to have survived from the fourth century, when Chinese Buddha images were heavily influenced by the art of ancient Gandhara in modern Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India. Chinese characteristics make this statue an important milestone in the development of Buddhist art in China. The figure’s arrangement, with legs crossed beneath an evenly draped robe and set on a rectangular pedestal, is probably modeled after a Gandharan prototype brought to China via the Silk Road. However, this Buddha’s overlapping, inward-facing palms are adopted from a formal Chinese gesture of reverence. His face, hairstyle, robe, and throne have also been adapted according to Chinese preferences to attract native devotees. The social and political chaos and the invasions of nomadic peoples from the north contributed to the rapid spread of Buddhism among various ethnic groups who all sought spiritual relief and a better afterlife. The fragmentary inscription on the back of the base indicates this statue belonged to the Later Zhao kingdom (319–351), a kingdom founded in Hebei by a nomadic people who eventually controlled most of northern China. It was in this kingdom where Buddhism became a state-sponsored, widespread religion after being a minority religion for hundreds of years. This statue was commissioned by a monk who  was probably a foreign disciple of the famous Indian monk Fotudeng. Fotudeng arrived in the Central Plains in 310, preaching the Buddhist faith and seeking converts. He was trusted by Later Zhao rulers as a miraculous and venerated master and served as the principal religious counsel and military adviser in their campaigns to expand the territory. To worship Buddha for blessings of victory, these non-Han rulers commissioned the building of large-scale temples, the construction of ornamented grottoes, and the mass production of Buddhist statues.

There is substantial evidence for the importance of Islamic art at his court. The success of Zheng He's exploration (see cat. no. 65) further encouraged the emperor's hopes of a rapprochement with other parts of the world. Foreign envoys who returned with Zheng He, bearing various tributes, particularly amazed the Yongle emperor. To better fulfill China's diplomatic missions, as well as to reap the benefits of trade, myriad Chinese products were prepared for Zheng He's fleets. The most valuable good that China could produce in mass quantities during this era was porcelain. A 1988 excavation by archaeologists found ruin strata of early Ming-dynasty official kilns in Jingdezhen. Remains of large porcelain plates, bowls, and jars discovered in the Yongle-period stratum are now known to have been created as exports for Islamic markets. Never in the history of Chinese ceramic manufacture had as many foreigninspired forms taken shape as in the Yongle emperor's factories. Certain forms among these were even adopted for use in the imperial palaces and temples. One statistic suggests that nine out of twenty-one whiteglazed ceremonial types have forms originating in Islamic metalwork (Urban Council et al. 1989, pp. 22 – 23, pl. 1, 4 – 6, 8 – 9, 11, 13, 22). Three of those nine types are represented by this group of water utensils from the Asian Art Museum collection, demonstrating the Yongle emperor's preference for the Islamic style. They share similaritiesin their precise potting, refined clay, and smooth glaze without air bubbles. Decorations were rendered in quality materials with precious cobalt imported from the Islamic world, producing distinctive color and luster. Painted on the clay body, the cobalt, with its high iron and low magnesium content, turned to dark blue through glazing and firing, with irregular ferruginous strains where it had curdled. The decorative subjects on these three works combine motifs from different sources: the Chinese traditional meander and flowers, stylized arabesques of Islamic influence, and the Buddhist Eight Treasures and essential lotus.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/74112/preview,"H. 14 1/2 in x Diam. 7 in x W.. 8 1/8  in, H. 36.8 cm x W. 17.8 cm x D. 20.6 cm",,,B60P85,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",,,,Handled ewer with a spout

A member of the first generation of artists to be raised and trained in the People's Republic, Li rose from poverty to national acclaim in the 1980s. His compositions are innovative and whimsical, often with a touch of his equally eccentric calligraphy. The saturated ink in the foreground group of rocks and the trees provides an interesting foil to the diluted washes that form the mountains and low hills. An avid writer on the nature of Chinese painting and its role in society, Li often expressed his opinions in public forums. His views on traditional painting are clear from this painting's inscription, in which he rejects the dictum to copy scenes from China's eastern landscape, instead opting to depict his native region. Such views made him the object of much criticism and disgrace at the hands of the leaders of political campaigns in the later 1980s. The inscription on this painting reads: Dwelling in the mountains. The hills and mountains of Sichuan have many rivers and streams. Its woods and forests are lush and interesting. Gradually I realize why one does not have to paint famous mountains and rivers.

Set in a snowy, rugged terrain is the female rider named Wang Zhaojun who is accompanied by an entourage of three figures. The group appears as if parading on a stage—the main character Zhaojun is led by a player lifting a folding fan and an acrobat doing a somersault; she is also followed by a female attendant carrying a flag. Many plays portrayed Emperor Yuandi (died 33 bce) of the Han dynasty and Lady Zhaojun as tragic lovers. It is said that Yuandi thought of Zhaojun as less beloved based on her portrait and thus gave her to the nomadic leader as part of a peace agreement. However, at the last moment the emperor discovered this palace woman’s exceptional beauty, but it was too late to cancel the edict and keep her in his harem. Many scenes in Chinese visual arts depict Lady Zhaojun crossing the borderlands with symbolic elements, as in this tapestry. Zhaojun wears a feathered headdress and carries a lute-like instrument (pipa). These items represent the ambiguity in ethnic and cultural identity that has accompanied the development of the story. The feathered headdress often appears in operas on nomadic characters from the steppe.

There is substantial evidence for the importance of Islamic art at his court. The success of Zheng He's exploration (see cat. no. 65) further encouraged the emperor's hopes of a rapprochement with other parts of the world. Foreign envoys who returned with Zheng He, bearing various tributes, particularly amazed the Yongle emperor. To better fulfill China's diplomatic missions, as well as to reap the benefits of trade, myriad Chinese products were prepared for Zheng He's fleets. The most valuable good that China could produce in mass quantities during this era was porcelain. A 1988 excavation by archaeologists found ruin strata of early Ming-dynasty official kilns in Jingdezhen. Remains of large porcelain plates, bowls, and jars discovered in the Yongle-period stratum are now known to have been created as exports for Islamic markets. Never in the history of Chinese ceramic manufacture had as many foreigninspired forms taken shape as in the Yongle emperor's factories. Certain forms among these were even adopted for use in the imperial palaces and temples. One statistic suggests that nine out of twenty-one whiteglazed ceremonial types have forms originating in Islamic metalwork (Urban Council et al. 1989, pp. 22 – 23, pl. 1, 4 – 6, 8 – 9, 11, 13, 22). Three of those nine types are represented by this group of water utensils from the Asian Art Museum collection, demonstrating the Yongle emperor's preference for the Islamic style. They share similarities in their precise potting, refined clay, and smooth glaze without air bubbles. Decorations were rendered in quality materials with precious cobalt imported from the Islamic world, producing distinctive color and luster. Painted on the clay body, the cobalt, with its high iron and low magnesium content, turned to dark blue through glazing and firing, with irregular ferruginous strains where it had curdled.

In addition, folk customs that secured a fortuitous marriage once went hand in hand with traditional symbols for a harmonious marriage: It was fabled that a certain bride, on leaving the house of her parents to go to that of her husband, was met and devoured by a tiger. [Therefore], in the past, the parents of the bridegroom, to prevent so serious a catastrophe, suspended a piece of meat at the door, as a bribe to this cruel monster. Suspending a looking-glass within the marriage bed was thought to expel all evil spirits that may enter, for evil spirits, or demons, cannot endure to see their own forms. Arranging pans of flowers around the bed was regarded as an offering to the gods to promote the birth of children. (Williams, C. A.

These works have also a distinctly sexual element. A person's arm or body is strung and held by another person, who plays the stringed body as if it were the lute, cello, or harp it resembles.

Examples by famous artists such as Wang Duo were particularly popular, serving as vehicles for members of the educated elite to share their thoughts free from the bounds of time and place. This work has laudatory comments by seven of the leading experts on Chinese painting and calligraphy of the late-nineteenth and the early-twentieth century. Four of these comments were added after Ye Gongchao had ""rescued"" the piece from Japan, where it had been taken during the second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). This handscroll contains five compositions. The first piece, ""Memory of Central Garden,"" is arranged in two sections. It presents a moment of historical change for the Central Garden, which was actually a village on the outskirts of Chengdu, Sichuan province. The second composition, titled ""Cherishing the Memory of my Mentor, Brother Wang Muji, the Late Governor Living in Danyang,"" plays tribute to Wang Muji, a close friend and mentor of the calligrapher, and describes Wang as a honorable official who was determined to battle against enemies. The third essay, titled ""The Han Army's March on Cold Plum Temple,"" consists of three sections praising the triumph of the Han army over the Qin dynasty (221–207 BCE.). A fourth section, the seven-character poem ""Living in Chang'an as a Guest,"" continues the theme of friendship. The authenticity of this handscroll is not questioned in any of its seven inscriptions and colophons.

What is innovative about this composition? First, night scenes are relatively rare in Chinese painting as they require a reversal of the usual technique; most of the painting surface must be covered with rich bluish ink and the details of the scene painted in lighter colors or indicated by areas of untouched paper. Also, this is clearly an exotic scene; the towering bamboo and the architectural style indicate a location somewhere in far southern China. Zhang Bu is known for his dramatic use of color and for dynamic compositions. Born in Hebei province in 1934, Zhang studied painting at the Central Academy of Fine Art in Beijing with Li Keran. Li was trained in Europe and was among the artists active in China during his generation who attempted to combine elements of Western painting with those of traditional Chinese. His influence on Zhang BuÆs work is seen in the use of light, shading, and many other elements.

Through depictions of the fisherman’s life in painting, artists conveyed the spiritual ideal of a peaceful life free of political corruption. The appeal of this landscape lies in its portrayal of tasteful and charming mountain villages in summer. An unknown artist aimed to capture the rustic life and activity of country people in a narrative way, arranged in a succession of diagonal planes from bottom to top. The foreground of the painting shows fishermen either casting away from shore, holding a fishing rod, or gathering for drink and food.

Depicted on one side of the cup is a a large sailing boat on river waves with eight people pulling oars. The two scholars standing outside of a tall castle are probably Su Shi and an associate arriving in the ancient city of Huangzhou. The story ends on the opposite side with a depiction of a river bank with anchored boats. The openwork carving on the handle consists of trees and craggy mountains that continue inside the mouth. Rhinoceros horn (which is actually a dense accretion of hair) is well-suited for carving. The decoration on horn cups often shares themes with other functional arts, such as lacquer carving and ceramics. Very few rhinoceros horn cups were created during most of the 1400s and the first decades of the 1500s; this can be attributed to the rarity of the animal in China, along with restrictions on imports from other countries. These import restrictions were lifted in 1565, which corresponded with a period of economic prosperity throughout much of China. Demand for luxury items like cups made from rhino horn was high at this time. As a result, the period from 1565 through the early 1700s is considered the classical period for carved rhino horn cups. But demand for horn exceeded the supply, and the rhinoceros was driven to the point of extinction throughout much of East and Southeast Asia. The Rhinoceros in Chinese Culture Rhinoceros horn was thought by the Chinese to help cure certain diseases, neutralize poisons, and increase male virility. The horn was both ground for medicine and carved into elaborate vessels for wealthy patrons. Such vessels might be artworks in themselves, and finest were - and are - eagerly sought by collectors. Archaeological evidence indicates that in ancient times rhinoceros were also harvested for their thick skins, which were used as armor. Overhunting and destruction of habitat caused the rhinoceros to become nearly extinct in China by the beginning of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). Unfortunately, demand for animal products with purported medicinal qualities remains strong today, and this demand - exacerbated by the country's recent economic boom - is still a major factor in the extinction or near extinction of a number of animal species. It has also led to a strong market for antique rhino horn cups. In the past decade the high price paid at auction for rhino horn has increased by a factor of more than twenty. This is reflected in the high monetary values recently given to rhino horn cups on the television program Antiques Roadshow. The famous ritual vessel in the shape of a rhinoceros on display in gallery 14 on the museum's third floor is one of the earliest and most realistic depictions of the rhinoceros to be found anywhere in the world. In ancient times two species of rhino frequented the woods and grasslands of China; one was small and had a single horn. The second was much larger, and had two horns. The bronze rhino vessel depicts the second type. It shows that the cultural importance of the rhinoceros for the Chinese began in ancient times. Today many people in China and throughout the world are working to protect this magnificent endangered animal.

She also learned the technique of free embroidery from Miss Yang Shouyu, and used this medium to create abstract works. Lu graduated from the Art College of Chengzhi, and also studied painting and sculpture at the Chicago Art Institute (1959) and the New York University (1967).

It is a masterful composition describing the meeting, the life story, the music, his feelings, and the minute detail of the musician's fine technique.

There are many reasons for the popularity of cinnabar: for one, the Chinese term for this shade of red is zhu, which is the same character as the surname of the ruling family of the Ming dynasty. Red was also the dynastic color for the Ming and a color that represents happiness and good fortune to the Chinese. A sophisticated understanding of the medium was required before carved lacquers could be created. In order to undergo the chemical change required for curing, lacquer must be applied in thin coats. The thick coverings necessary for carving are achieved by applying multiple coats. The most complex carved lacquers might have a thin wood core reinforced with a layer of lacquer-impregnated cloth; base coats created by adding combinations of ash, rice paste, wood powder, or fine clay to lacquer; and multiple finish coats of refined lacquer. Each coat has special qualities of sealing, filling, leveling, and finishing, and must be applied in the proper conditions and in proper sequence. Since each coat must be cured and mechanically smoothed before another is added, the thickest applications can require as much as a year from the initial coat to the final finish. (The complexity of these applications are well described in Ohba 1988.) These technical challenges had been overcome by the Song dynasty, making possible the elaborately carved works for which the Ming is famous. This piece presents a long-tailed bird in a garden bordered by flowers of the four seasons. The theme of birds in a garden setting or with a floral background can be traced back to themes for painting at the Southern Song court. The early Ming emperors harked back to this earlier Chinese dynasty and the arts created there to give legitimacy to their own rule.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/73520/preview,H. 1 1/2 in x Diam. 12 5/8 in,,,B62M8,China,,,,Plate with long-tailed bird in a garden

Shieh's paintings contain a strong sense of inner contemplation influenced by literary and ancient painting styles. His art is centered on people often situated in peculiar and compromising scenarios. These eccentricities are a subtle statement about our times, and for the artist part and parcel of life in Hong Kong, which is always changing. In this series entitled Musical Bodies, people become instruments, and instruments become people—transformations that introduce a distinctly surreal effect. These works have also a distinctly sexual element. A person's arm or body is strung and held by another person, who plays the stringed body as if it were the lute, cello, or harp it resembles. The actions of the characters and their gestures are of supreme importance to Shieh's visual language. Shieh was one of the few students of his era who chose to study traditional fine-line painting at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where he received his B.A. (1994) and M.F.A. (2000).

Keeping track of who is who is a challenge even for the most dedicated fan. Most popular print depictions of Chinese opera fall into one of two categories: either showing the actors in full stage costume in a landscape or architectural setting or as they would appear on a stage traditionally set with minimal props. As the popularity of the theater grew beginning in the early 1800s, production of theatrical prints also surged. Popular prints became an important part of folk tradition nearly a thousand years ago, and they remain so today. These prints are used for residential decoration and viewing pleasure, and can be purchased throughout the year. Varied in subject, color, and format, the prints are often glued on doors, windows, walls, pillars, furniture, and any place outdoors around the house. Celebratory themes and images pictured on the prints bear wishes for a happy New Year, a long life, health, fortune, continuation of the family line, and protections against evil-many of the prominent themes embedded in symbols on Chinese art. Popular prints were made either using woodblock printing or using offset lithography, a technique that largely replaced woodblock printing from the early twentieth century onward. Derived from lithography, the offset process involves three cylinders: 1. The artist creates the image on the plate cylinder as he or she would like it to appear in print (that is, a positive image). 2. The image is transferred to the rubber offset cylinder as a negative. 3. Paper is fed between the offset cylinder and the impression cylinder, which presses the image onto the paper and results in a positive print.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/9962/preview,Image: H. 13 1/2 in × W. 18 3/4 in (34.3 cm × 47.6 cm) Overall: H. 17 1/16 in × W. 21 5/8 in (43.3 cm × 54.9 cm),,,2010.186,China,,,,Theatrical scene

In this painting, Zheng combined the two in a manner that raises the question: ""is the artist's subject an inscribed rock or did he simply choose an unusual place in the composition to record his thoughts?"" Either is possible. From ancient times Chinese scholars have carved inscriptions recording historical events or recording their own philosophical insights into rock. Some of these were famous stones left in the wild, but in the Song dynasty (960–1279), rock collectors also began to inscribe rocks that they brought into their gardens and studies. Zheng could very well be painting an inscribed rock. On the other hand, the content of the inscription relates to the overall topic of the painting and seems to be a personal reflection. It reads: There are many orchids in the mountains, but no fungi. I asked a painter where I could find them. ""Seek them in your own heart because only you who cultivate them there can fathom what you yourself have done.""

The hands are held in a standardized gesture, or mudra, with the gesture of religious discussion on the left and the gesture of gift-granting on the right.

The shallow-relief designs that ornament the exterior of the cup were also adopted from motifs found on ancient bronze vessels and jades. The main design on each side is a large beast mask known as a taotie. The main design of the cup consists of stylized phoenix patterns against a squared spiral ground. The cup features eight small dragons (chi long), seven on the outside, and one on the inside Rhinoceros horn (which is actually a dense accretion of hair) is well-suited for carving. The decoration on horn cups often shares themes with other functional arts, such as lacquer carving and ceramics. Very few rhinoceros horn cups were created during most of the 1400s and the first decades of the 1500s; this can be attributed to the rarity of the animal in China, along with restrictions on imports from other countries. These import restrictions were lifted in 1565, which corresponded with a period of economic prosperity throughout much of China. Demand for luxury items like cups made from rhino horn was high at this time. As a result, the period from 1565 through the early 1700s is considered the classical period for carved rhino horn cups. But demand for horn exceeded the supply, and the rhinoceros was driven to the point of extinction throughout much of East and Southeast Asia. The Rhinoceros in Chinese Culture Rhinoceros horn was thought by the Chinese to help cure certain diseases, neutralize poisons, and increase male virility. The horn was both ground for medicine and carved into elaborate vessels for wealthy patrons. Such vessels might be artworks in themselves, and finest were - and are - eagerly sought by collectors. Archaeological evidence indicates that in ancient times rhinoceros were also harvested for their thick skins, which were used as armor. Overhunting and destruction of habitat caused the rhinoceros to become nearly extinct in China by the beginning of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). Unfortunately, demand for animal products with purported medicinal qualities remains strong today, and this demand - exacerbated by the country's recent economic boom - is still a major factor in the extinction or near extinction of a number of animal species. It has also led to a strong market for antique rhino horn cups. In the past decade the high price paid at auction for rhino horn has increased by a factor of more than twenty. This is reflected in the high monetary values recently given to rhino horn cups on the television program Antiques Roadshow. The famous ritual vessel in the shape of a rhinoceros on display in gallery 14 on the museum's third floor is one of the earliest and most realistic depictions of the rhinoceros to be found anywhere in the world. In ancient times two species of rhino frequented the woods and grasslands of China; one was small and had a single horn. The second was much larger, and had two horns. The bronze rhino vessel depicts the second type. It shows that the cultural importance of the rhinoceros for the Chinese began in ancient times. Today many people in China and throughout the world are working to protect this magnificent endangered animal.

Some areas, such as the islands of Indonesia, did not have large-scale ceramics industries of their own. Others, such as Japan, Persia, and Siam (now known as Thailand), had such industries but still wanted Chinese wares, some of which were technically superior to most of their locally made wares. Merchants and suppliers learned early on that they could sell more of their products by customizing them for the needs and tastes of various foreign markets.

Keeping track of who is who is a challenge even for the most dedicated fan. Most popular print depictions of Chinese opera fall into one of two categories: either showing the actors in full stage costume in a landscape or architectural setting or as they would appear on a stage traditionally set with minimal props. As the popularity of the theater grew beginning in the early 1800s, production of theatrical prints also surged. Popular prints became an important part of folk tradition nearly a thousand years ago, and they remain so today. These prints are used for residential decoration and viewing pleasure, and can be purchased throughout the year. Varied in subject, color, and format, the prints are often glued on doors, windows, walls, pillars, furniture, and any place outdoors around the house. Celebratory themes and images pictured on the prints bear wishes for a happy New Year, a long life, health, fortune, continuation of the family line, and protections against evil-many of the prominent themes embedded in symbols on Chinese art. Popular prints were made either using woodblock printing or using offset lithography, a technique that largely replaced woodblock printing from the early twentieth century onward. Derived from lithography, the offset process involves three cylinders: 1. The artist creates the image on the plate cylinder as he or she would like it to appear in print (that is, a positive image). 2. The image is transferred to the rubber offset cylinder as a negative. 3. Paper is fed between the offset cylinder and the impression cylinder, which presses the image onto the paper and results in a positive print.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/9965/preview,Image: H. 17 1/8 in × W. 22 3/8 in (43.5 cm × 56.8 cm) Overall: H. 13 3/8 in × W. 19 7/16 in (34 cm × 49.4 cm),,,2010.189,China,,,,Scene from The Water Margin

The shallow-relief designs that ornament the exterior of the cup were also adopted from motifs found on ancient bronze vessels and jades. The main design on each side is a large beast mask known as a taotie. Rhinoceros horn (which is actually a dense accretion of hair) is well-suited for carving. The decoration on horn cups often shares themes with other functional arts, such as lacquer carving and ceramics. Very few rhinoceros horn cups were created during most of the 1400s and the first decades of the 1500s; this can be attributed to the rarity of the animal in China, along with restrictions on imports from other countries. These import restrictions were lifted in 1565, which corresponded with a period of economic prosperity throughout much of China. Demand for luxury items like cups made from rhino horn was high at this time. As a result, the period from 1565 through the early 1700s is considered the classical period for carved rhino horn cups. But demand for horn exceeded the supply, and the rhinoceros was driven to the point of extinction throughout much of East and Southeast Asia. The Rhinoceros in Chinese Culture Rhinoceros horn was thought by the Chinese to help cure certain diseases, neutralize poisons, and increase male virility. The horn was both ground for medicine and carved into elaborate vessels for wealthy patrons. Such vessels might be artworks in themselves, and finest were - and are - eagerly sought by collectors. Archaeological evidence indicates that in ancient times rhinoceros were also harvested for their thick skins, which were used as armor. Overhunting and destruction of habitat caused the rhinoceros to become nearly extinct in China by the beginning of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). Unfortunately, demand for animal products with purported medicinal qualities remains strong today, and this demand - exacerbated by the country's recent economic boom - is still a major factor in the extinction or near extinction of a number of animal species. It has also led to a strong market for antique rhino horn cups. In the past decade the high price paid at auction for rhino horn has increased by a factor of more than twenty. This is reflected in the high monetary values recently given to rhino horn cups on the television program Antiques Roadshow. The famous ritual vessel in the shape of a rhinoceros on display in gallery 14 on the museum's third floor is one of the earliest and most realistic depictions of the rhinoceros to be found anywhere in the world. In ancient times two species of rhino frequented the woods and grasslands of China; one was small and had a single horn. The second was much larger, and had two horns. The bronze rhino vessel depicts the second type. It shows that the cultural importance of the rhinoceros for the Chinese began in ancient times. Today many people in China and throughout the world are working to protect this magnificent endangered animal.

Shorenstein Foundation,,Ink on paper,,,,Not on view,Chinese Art,,1231-1322,,Books And Manuscripts,,,Song dynasty (960-1279) or Yuan dynasty (1271-1368),"This manuscript contains one chapter from a Buddhist sutra (scripture) included in the Jisha edition of the Chinese Buddhist Canon. The Dharani (Magical Charm) Sutra of Great Splendor (Mahatejas Dharani Sutra) was translated from Sanskrit into Chinese during the sixth century. The earliest complete printed edition of the Chinese Buddhist Canon was produced by imperial decree in the late tenth century. In the following centuries, other printed editions were undertaken by various Buddhist establishments including the Yenshengyuan monastery. Printing of the Jisha edition, named for the island on which the monastery was located, began in 1231 but was halted by a fire in 1258. By the time printing resumed in 1299, the ruling Song dynasty had been replaced by the Yuan dynasty, which proclaimed Tibetan Buddhism the official state religion. This frontispiece reveals Tibetan and Nepalese influences in the figural styles of the Buddha, his audience, and the bodhisattva seated on a lotus throne at the left. The image is unusual in its incorporation of landscape elements into the background. The complete Jisha edition consisted of 6,362 printed volumes containing 1,532 texts and would have required the carving of more than 150,000 woodblocks. The entire edition had been considered lost until some volumes were discovered in 1931 in Xian, Shaanxi province. About 80 percent of the original edition now survives in two monastic libraries in Xian and in collections worldwide.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/69955/preview,Image: H. 11 15/16 in × W. 270 11/16 in (30.3 cm × 687.5 cm) Overall: H. 11 15/16 in × W. 275 1/8 in (30.3 cm × 698.8 cm),,,1991.208,"Suzhou, Jiangsu province, China",,,,A Manuscript containing Chapter 2 of the Dharani Sutra of Great Splendor (Daweide tuoluoni jing)

The foreigners are shown in an inventive and amusing assortment of facial colors and non-Chinese garments or armor. They bring with them a statue of a lion, an incense burner, three exotic horses, and other gifts. The picture, which is read from right to left, is based on a formal ceremony actually undertaken at the court for such occasions. The procession of tribute bearers was a favorite theme of the Tang dynasty rulers (618-906), who forged political and economic contacts with many countries. The practice also flourished during the Mongol-ruled Yuan dynasty (1280-1368). Official histories document the fact that the Yuan emperor Huidi (reigned 1333-1368) was fascinated by a gift of exotic horses presented to him by the Catholic Church of France in 1342. At a banquet to honor those Western missions, Huidi ordered court artists to compose prose and paintings commemorating ""the horse tribute."" This scroll may be a depiction of that event. The work is signed by Ren Bowen, who is thought to be the heir of two generations of a family of noted horse and figure painters. This painting, along with three other, similar versions by the Ren family that survive today, serves as a historical record of a diplomatic link between China and the West.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/49395/preview,Overall: H. 14 7/8 in × W. 206 1/2 in (37.8 cm × 524.5 cm) Image: H. 13 11/16 in × W. 87 1/4 in (34.8 cm × 221.6 cm),,,B60D100,,,,,Tribute Bearers

Prints of door gods come in pairs, to be pasted on the two doors of the main entrance of a traditional Chinese home. Such a public positioning is meant to keep out evil and atrract prosperity. The figures face each other in order to better observe everything that passes through the door. The two most frequently seen door gods represent the generals Qin Qiong and Yuchi Gong, who are celebrated for having saved a Tang dynasty (618–906) emperor from the threat of demons. Each can be identified by his weapon: Yuchi Gong holds a steel whip and Qin Qiong grasps a sword. The two generals Yuchi Gong and Qin Qiong guard four boys clustered around their oldest brother, who rides the mythical beast known as the qilin. The five boys, educated by their strict father, Imperial Advisor Dou Yi (active 950–970), all passed the imperial civil examinations. The family has been regarded throughout Chinese history as the embodiment of an intellectual ideal. The motif here suggests many auspicious themes: wishes for many sons who all attain official posts and carry objects that convey wishes of luck, fortune, and happiness for the household. Popular prints became an important part of folk tradition nearly a thousand years ago, and they remain so today. These prints are used for residential decoration and viewing pleasure, and can be purchased throughout the year. Varied in subject, color, and format, the prints are often glued on doors, windows, walls, pillars, furniture, and any place outdoors around the house.

Popular prints were made either using woodblock printing or using offset lithography, a technique that largely replaced woodblock printing from the early twentieth century onward. Derived from lithography, the offset process involves three cylinders: 1. The artist creates the image on the plate cylinder as he or she would like it to appear in print (that is, a positive image). 2. The image is transferred to the rubber offset cylinder as a negative. 3.

Keeping track of who is who is a challenge even for the most dedicated fan. Illustrated in the print are the five main characters of the Chinese opera "" Eight Sledgehammers"" (Ba dachui); each is identified on a cartouche. This opera is based on three chapters of a much longer novel about the celebrated General Yue Fei (1103-1141) of the Song dynasty (960-1279), and his battles with the rival Jin dynasty (founded 1115). The opera focuses on the episodes involving Lu Wenlong (center), an adopted Jin warrior ignorant of his Song descent. Flanking Lu in this composition are General Yue's four warriors (from right to left): Yue Yun, He Yuanqing, Di Lei, and Yan Chengfang. Each wields a pair of sledgehammers as his weapons, hence the title of the opera. This scene is a reference to the pivotal battle between the four warriors and Lu Wenlong.the warriors were ultimately defeated, but it was after this battle that General Yue learned of Lu's parentage.and thus convinced him to switch sides.

This tale later became a popular subject and generations of artists depicted this imagined scene in various styles and mediums.

The earliest complete printed edition of the Chinese Buddhist Canon was produced, by imperial decree, in the late tenth century. Many copies, and various editions based upon it, were known not only in China but also in Japan and Korea. A second printed edition of the Canon, prepared under the guidance of the chief priests of the Dongchan Temple in Fuzhou, began to be published (in installments) in the late eleventh century. More than one-and-a-half times the length of the earlier publication, it was widely admired and became the model for future editions of the Canon through the Ming dynasty.

In the number of characters and lines per page, it followed the format of earlier hand-copied manuscripts. Preparation of a printed Buddhist canon was a massive undertaking.

In traditional Asian food markets, tofu is freshly made and stored on wooden pallets; in emulating this presentation, Ah Leon lends his piece a local, everyday appeal. He has skillfully merged the Western technique of trompe l'oeil with subject matter that has meaning and resonance within his Chinese background, forming a unique way for art to be viewed across cultures and time. Formerly a student of the National Academy of Arts, Ah Leon spent several years as an artist-in-residence in the United States, where he became acquainted with American ceramic artists using trompe l'oeil styles.

Vietnamese wares of this period have been found from Japan to Turkey, but the primary market for these ceramics was Southeast Asia. All of the items in this case were excavated from a shipwreck found off the coast of Vietnam near the city of Hoi An. It is believed this ship originated in Siam (now known as Thailand) and was one of many vessels sailing between that country and the north coast of Vietnam. Much of the cargo may have been destined for Indonesia, where similar objects have been found. Excavation of the vessel yielded over a quarter-million items. The skill of the artists can be seen in the wide variety of wares produced as well as in the range of motifs-from floral to fantastic.

Others, such as Japan, Persia, and Siam (now known as Thailand), had such industries but still wanted Chinese wares, some of which were technically superior to most of their locally made wares.

At the same time, China's interest in outward exploration helped open trade routes through which large quantities of ceramics were exported. In the early 1400s the Muslim admiral Zheng He led Chinese naval fleets on a series of expeditions around the world. Meanwhile, other countries were developing their own blue-and-white technologies. In Korea, King Seizong (1418-1450) ordered artisans at the official kiln Gwangju-gun in Gyeonggi-do to make porcelains decorated with Chinese cobalt. The discovery of Korean cobalt in 1464 stimulated local production of exquisitely painted blue-and-white ceramics.

Keeping track of who is who is a challenge even for the most dedicated fan. Illustrated in the print are the five main characters of the Chinese opera "" Eight Sledgehammers"" (Ba dachui); each is identified on a cartouche. This opera is based on three chapters of a much longer novel about the celebrated General Yue Fei (1103-1141) of the Song dynasty (960-1279), and his battles with the rival Jin dynasty (founded 1115). The opera focuses on the episodes involving Lu Wenlong (center), an adopted Jin warrior ignorant of his Song descent. Flanking Lu in this composition are General Yue's four warriors (from right to left): Yue Yun, He Yuanqing, Di Lei, and Yan Chengfang. Each wields a pair of sledgehammers as his weapons, hence the title of the opera. This scene is a reference to the pivotal battle between the four warriors and Lu Wenlong.the warriors were ultimately defeated, but it was after this battle that General Yue learned of Lu's parentage.and thus convinced him to switch sides. Most popular print depictions of Chinese opera fall into one of two categories: either showing the actors in full stage costume in a landscape or architectural setting or as they would appear on a stage traditionally set with minimal props. As the popularity of the theater grew beginning in the early 1800s, production of theatrical prints also surged.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/9961/preview,"H. 13 1/2 in x W. 19 1/2 in, H. 34.3 cm x W. 49.5 cm",,,2010.185,China,,,,Scene from Eight Sledgehammers

Her father was the artist Lu Fengzi (1886-1959), a former president of the National Art College of Suzhou. She studied painting and calligraphy under the tutelage of her father. She also learned the technique of free embroidery from Miss Yang Shouyu, and used this medium to create abstract works. Lu graduated from the Art College of Chengzhi, and also studied painting and sculpture at the Chicago Art Institute (1959) and the New York University (1967). The set of album leaves is inspired by the ""Pipaxing,"" or ""Song of the Lute"" the famous poem by the Tang poet Bo Juyi (772-846). Written in 816, this was Bo Juyi's most famous work, after the ""Song of Everlasting Sorrow."" In the poem, Bo Juyi described a musician he heard playing in a boat on the river. It is a masterful composition describing the meeting, the life story, the music, his feelings, and the minute detail of the musician's fine technique. Lu Wu-chiu painted the set of album leaves between 1988 and 1991 in Oakland, California. She attempted, she said, ""to describe and express, by abstract paintings, the passions, emotions, and feelings"" of this lengthy work. There are 88 lines to the poem. The album consists of a total of 44 paintings, each one illustrating two lines of poetry.

In both examples, the entire body was first covered with thick layers of red lacquer and then designs were carved into it. These designs were then filled with colored lacquer; in the case of the sutra cover lacquer with gold powder, in the case of this box lacquer with yellow, green and dark pigments. The Chinese term for the technique used on the sutra cover is qiangjin (lit. inlaid gold) while the technique used on this box is tianqi (lit. inlaid lacquer). The top of the cover of this box is decorated with four branches of flower blossoms, which can be identified as chrysanthemum, lotus, peony, and probably Chinese herbaceous peony, surrounding a central six-petal mallow flower. The same four flowers are repeated on the border with each blossom set in a lobed panel. These panels are separated by a diamond-pattered ground. The body of the box is decorated with six chrysanthemum branches also carved into the red base coat and filled with colored lacquer. Seasonal flowers were a common theme in the court arts of the Ming dynasty. As a group they represent prosperity through the four seasons. Providing a precise date for this piece is somewhat problematic. The technique was in use from the beginning of the Ming dynasty and some experts date this piece to the reign of the Xuande emperor (1426 – 1435).

In Chinese iconography the vase may serve as a container for a variety of other symbols, producing many interesting rebuses. A picture of a vase with flowers from all four seasons is a rebus for ""may one enjoy peace in all seasons."" Around the New Year, if a vessel is broken, the phrase ""peace and safety every year"" (suì suì píng an ) is spoken to offset the bad omen, since sui means both to break and year.

This unusual example has two compartments and two spouts for the purpose of serving two types of tea from the same vessel. When tea was introduced to Europe in the mid-1600s, teapots from Yixing (considered the best for brewing) were included with the first shipment of tea leaves. The inclusion of pots with two compartments was a ploy to encourage the tasting of different varieties of tea. Europeans treasured these teapots and gave them silver or gold mounts to protect the spouts from chipping. Engraved on the silver bands around this teapot's spouts are the names of varieties of tea once served in it. The pot has an overhead handle, and its square lid is surmounted by a small figure of a lion. The Chinese character cheng (meaning ""correct"") was inscribed on both the lid and shoulder to facilitate proper alignment. The front and back of the square body are decorated with swastikas (an auspicious Chinese motif) in an openwork design. This teapot was once in the Mottahedeh Collection, a famous East Coast collection of export ware. It was donated to the Asian Art Museum by trustee Marjorie Bissinger, who had played a pivotal role in bringing the Avery Brundage Collection to San Francisco.

This print depicts a celebration of female fertility at the Sisters Festival. During this spring event, women traditionally don multiple layers of clothing colorfully embroidered and trimmed with brocades. Over these are worn an abundance of heavy silver jewelry in the shapes of discs and crescents, geometric forms believed to represent the origin of nature and life. The jewelry's circular shapes echo the full moon, which seems to cast a golden glow on this scene. Excelling in both pottery and printmaking, Wang Jianshan adopted waste woodblock printing because it unifies such seemingly disparate elements as the colors of oil painting, lines of Chinese painting, and texture of fresco.

As her confident use of the brush reveals, she was still a robust artist. Moreover, she was not shy in commenting on the challenges of life as a single parent of eight children. She made statements on this subject in a number of ways: sometimes in her inscriptions, sometimes in her choice of subject matter, and often in an unconventional manner—in her seals. Fang used a great many seals during her life; she created many of them for a specific year, time, or event.

As a high-ranking official living in the northern capital, Beijing, Dong had rarely seen bamboo, a main component of the Chan world easily grown in the warm south. Dong inscribed a four-line poem on this painting to confess that he did not paint bamboo in the woods, which was a common scene admired by legendary sages. Placing high value on self-cultivation and seclusion in nature, he emphasized the spirituality of Chan philosophy over all visual materials including bamboo: How dense and luxuriant are the green woods, The tall pines piercing the sky.

Gongchuo remarks that he had seen more than ten works by Wang Duo, none of which were as carefully composed as this one. Wang's dedication to Jesuit missionary Johann Adam Schall von Bell (1591–1666, known in China as Tang Daowei or Tang Ruowang) increased its desirability. The last section, which is in seal script (zhuanshu), also appealed to Gongchuo since examples of this script by Wang Duo were exceptionally rare. Gongchuo celebrates the purchase with two inscriptions: ""This poetry handscroll, is now in my hand""and ""Inscribed for acquiring this piece in the first month of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic [1936], Gongchuo."" This piece assembles three unrelated compositions by Wang Duo. The first is an important example of communication between a member of the educated elite of China in the 1600s and a Jesuit missionary. It consists of a long poem written in cursive script (caoshu) and dedicated to von Bell. Wang records his responses to von Bell's tales and descriptions of the Western world, which were told over many meetings between the two men.

Wang's preface to the record of the event became one of the most famous and influential calligraphies in Chinese history. The event—at which a group of likeminded intellectuals gathered to drink wine, enjoy and compose poetry, practice various arts including calligraphy, and appreciate the natural surroundings—became a model for Elegant Gatherings in the centuries that followed. Gui used a cursive script known as kuang cao, or ""crazy grass script,"" to create this work. At the end of the calligraphy he described his motivation for writing out Wang Xizhi's work, stating that he felt it the greatest pity that Wang's original was buried in the tomb of the Tang dynasty emperor Li Taizong (reigned 626–649) but that the fame of the work would survive forever.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/11239/preview,"H. 12 3/4 in x W. 194 in, H. 32.4 cm x W. 492.8 cm (image); H. 13 7/8 in, 35.2 cm (overall)",,,2013.23,,,,,Orchid Pavilion Preface (Lanting Xu) In Cursive Script (Caoshu)

He also employed a technique that combined solid strokes for the foreground details with blurred application of light ink for deep perspective.

Reminding himself of Tao Yuanming’s story, Zou Zhe called himself a “fishing man,” as seen in his signature here. This painting portrays a man gazing pensively into the mist as if from a mountain pavilion. Some pathways fade into a forest and the roof of a cottage, while others lead to a river where a boat is anchored. Scenes depicting idealized environments like this are common in traditional painting throughout Chinese history. Such portrayals symbolize both the veneration of nature and the human journey toward spiritual cultivation. Zou Zhe belonged to a group of seventeenth-century artists from the Jinling (Nanjing) area in southeastern China. They challenged the court academy of painters by developing their own styles, which they used in correspondence and other personal pursuits. Some of these artists, including Zou Zhe, explored themes related to Tao Yuanming, who evoked for them the spiritual freedom of a noble soul. Painters have used both monochrome ink and the multicolor “blue-green”
style of ink to capture the idyllic secluded paradise described in verse by Tao
Yuanming. Artist Zou Zhe rendered this series of works in color; look for his
monochrome ink painting on view in this gallery. The six scenes are, from right
to left: Observing the water. Having stepped from their boat anchored below, two educated
elites sit in the corridor of a thatched house. Here, the artist concentrates
on depicting the vast expanse of water. Crossing a bridge. The two now cross a bridge toward a village
surrounded by pink shrubbery. The water in mid-ground extends as far as the
distant mountains. Sett l ing a zither ( qin ) under the moon. One of three scholars
points at the moon glimmering behind tree branches. A young servant holding a
wrapped zither walks along the running stream toward them. Watching a waterfall. The scene is viewed from a pavilion set high on

It is recorded that Wang once depicted a mural scene of the Wangchuan mountain in Shaanxi, where he spent ten years living a reclusive life. Possibly based on his viewing of later copies of the work, Song Xu rendered this long, horizontal painting that included about twenty sightseeing places of Wangchuan—craggy mountains, lush groves, thatched villas, and running water. His refined brushwork lends a pulsating, dynamic energy to the furrowed, continuous hills. Song’s inscription at the end of this handscroll records the reason for this creation. His friend was enchanted by a fourteenth-century copy of Wang’s Views of Wangchuan, and thus playfully challenged him to paint a work reminiscent of the original Wang painting. As agreed, when enjoying a summer retreat in the friend’s studio in 1574, Song completed this work. Song humbly stated that he did not even dream of “reaching the style of master Wang Wei”; he just wanted to “indulge the amusement” of his friend.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/62127/preview,"H. 12 3/8 in x W. 350 in, H. 31.4 cm x W. 889 cm (image); H. 12 5/8 in x W. 469 in, H. 32.1 cm x W. 1191.3 cm (overall)",,,B67D2,,,,,Landscape after Wang Wei’s “Wangchuan Picture”

The figures face each other in order to better observe everything that passes through the door. The two most frequently seen door gods represent the generals Qin Qiong and Yuchi Gong, who are celebrated for having saved a Tang dynasty (618-906) emperor from the threat of demons. Each can be identified by his weapon: Yuchi Gong holds a steel whip and Qin Qiong grasps a sword. Popular prints became an important part of folk tradition nearly a thousand years ago, and they remain so today. These prints are used for residential decoration and viewing pleasure, and can be purchased throughout the year. Varied in subject, color, and format, the prints are often glued on doors, windows, walls, pillars, furniture, and any place outdoors around the house. Celebratory themes and images pictured on the prints bear wishes for a happy New Year, a long life, health, fortune, continuation of the family line, and protections against evil-many of the prominent themes embedded in symbols on Chinese art.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/9954/preview,Image (.1): H. 20 3/8 × W. 9 11/16 in.

A tropical hardwood table with jade inlays? Or this brightly colored lacquered cabinet? Many connoisseurs of Chinese furniture would answer hardwood furniture; in fact, throughout China's long history including the period when these pieces were created, the majority of furniture made for the well-to-do and for the court was lacquered. Lacquer was expensive, and just owning it was a sign of prestige. It provided opportunities to display symbols of wealth, good fortune, and an ideal lifestyle so prevalent in Chinese arts. This cabinet is decorated all over in colored lacquers of crimson, gold, amber, brown, and black. The main scene depicted on the two doors presents a scholarly gathering of high-ranking officials in a large pavilion situated within a remote mountain setting. They engage activities such as enjoying music, reading, and painting. This type of gathering exemplifies the ideal of removing oneself from urban society and retreating into a reclusive life. Filling in the remaining spaces are auspicious motifs such as the fungus of immortality, ingot, and coral. The decoration on the side panels is separated into two parts. The top scene on both panels presents long-tailed pheasants in a flower garden, symbolizing prosperity and nobility. In the bottom scene of both panels are court officials engaging in outdoor activities. The edges of the cabinet's frame are decorated with floral scrolls alternating with peaches, peach blossoms, pomegranates, and plums. They relate to the theme of the ""Three Abundances"" (sanduo), which are long life, blessings, and many sons.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/73601/preview,H. 68 3/4 in x W. 49 in x D. 27 3/4 in,,,B69M5,China,,,,Cabinet

Fresh water examples such as the carp, catfish, perch, and goldfish (depicted here) appear on a regular basis. The fish represents abundance; fish (yu) is a pun on another yu that means surplus. The popular imagery of fish swimming amongst the lotus expresses the desire for abundance. A common theme includes a pond teeming with fish to represent the desire for wealth and success. A fish's head is considered especially auspicious. It is always a delicacy at a New Year's banquet because fish head (yú tóu) can also be interpreted as ""the beginning of wealth."" Families also eat fish during New Year's celebrations to ensure that they will have an abundance of good wishes in the coming months.

Debate surrounds many famous works in important collections around the world. In fact these debates were often part of the entertainment at Elegant Gatherings, during which diverse opinions might be freely shared. Works like this handscroll would be perfect subjects for such debates. This work bears the characters for the signature of Qian Xuan, a famous Yuan dynasty (1279–1368) painter of flower-and-bird subjects. It is the opinion of many experts, however, that the piece must have been made later. The sumptuous colors of the fruits and the exquisite brushwork combining clear outlines with colored vegetable and mineral dyes derive from techniques which began to be practiced at the imperial court during the 900s. Qian Xuan, whose name appears on this version, specialized in this technique. Although the scroll bears the signature of Qian Xuan and contains three colophons by artists living during the 1300s, based on its dramatic presentation of the subject and its rich colors, it is most likely a copy dating from the late Ming or early Qing dynasty.

After Qu went into exile, Song wrote “Nine Variations ( Jiubian )” in support of Qu’s purity and incorruptibility. The calligraphic inscription introduces a well-known admonition story between Song and King Qingxiang. According to the Anthology of Literature (Wenxuan) , the king rested in a palace when a sudden gust of wind blew in. Enjoying the wind, the king said “How delightful this wind is! And I and the common people may share it together, may we not?” His courier Song replied that two kinds of winds exist—one for his majesty alone and the other for ordinary folks.

In the painting a man on a donkey is about to step off a stone bridge and head to a thatched cottage ahead. The man’s worn, wide-brimmed hat and loose robe indicate his educated status. A subtle expression of the man’s eagerness to return home is expressed through his hands—one pulls the reins over the donkey’s head, while the other appears to be whipping the donkey’s buttock. In his four-line poem, Wang likened Wen’s inspiration to a classical event known as the send-off at Ba bridge, a site located in the suburbs of the Tang-dynasty capital of Chang’an; the bridge was where Tang elites would bid fond farewells to friends and loved ones.

This scene depicts a noted competition between a father and son from a family of calligraphers, the most famous in Chinese history.

Believing his calligraphy was superb as well, the son, Xianzhi, secretly erased his father’s writing and added his own. A few days later, Wang Xizhi found the writing not looking very good, but he comforted himself and told people that his scribbles were the result of being drunk. Xianzhi was embarrassed and vowed to continue improving his skills, eventually accomplishing the same fame as his father. The painting is possibly a self-portrait of Chang Dai-chien, a celebrated Chinese ink painter who sojourned in northern California for nearly a decade. Chang not only recounts the related story in his poetic inscription, but also brags that this painting is comparable to those of Madman Liang (Liang Kai, ca. 1140–1210), an eccentric Southern Song artist.

The top front register, framed by two dragons, illustrates a debate between Vimalakirti, a wealthy layman, and Manjushri, the bodhisattva of wisdom. Their encounter resonated with Chinese Buddhists because it demonstrated how a person could participate in a discussion of Buddhist doctrine on equal terms with a bodhisattva—a perfected, enlightened being. It reassured people that it was possible to honor Buddhist spiritual values but also pursue financial stability and take care of one’s family—an obligation embedded in Confucianism, China’s native state philosophy. The stele also includes images of Shakyamuni’s disciples, monks, and important bodhisattvas. The theme of rebirth in a Buddhist paradise is represented by four reborn souls emerging from the lotus blossoms on the canopy above the main image. In many Buddhist traditions it is believed that making images of the Buddha is an act of merit for both artist and patron. In China, groups of lay Buddhists often pooled their resources to commission large stone plaques shown as steles. A group of donors from Taiping county (modern Shanxi province) collaborated to produce this stele. Their names are incised in registers on its underside and sides, and a register of eight particularly prominent donors appears on the front along with simple portraits.

The Manchu conquest was a devastating event, yet outright protest was impossible. Becoming a recluse at a Buddhist monastery was one way of escaping the turmoil; indirect protest could be registered through the choice of a painting style and in the wording of inscriptions. This was the route chosen by Kuncan, who was eventually appointed abbot of a monastery near Nanjing. Kuncan's dry, rough style is personal, and it reflects something of his state of mind. In the painting's long inscription, he openly expresses his emotions: I grew weary of the city and retired to the riverside. Early in the morning, after bathing, I came to the famous Xiang River [in Hunan province] and sang sad songs to the cloudy mountaintops. This is the place where the Duke of Fan used to visit and hold gatherings. As I watched the dusty world, my mind reverted to a state of dejection and to the desolation of an unkempt garden.

Prints of door gods come in pairs, to be pasted on the two doors of the main entrance of a traditional Chinese home. Such a public positioning is meant to keep out evil and atrract prosperity. The figures face each other in order to better observe everything that passes through the door. The two most frequently seen door gods represent the generals Qin Qiong and Yuchi Gong, who are celebrated for having saved a Tang dynasty (618–906) emperor from the threat of demons. Each can be identified by his weapon: Yuchi Gong holds a steel whip and Qin Qiong grasps a sword. An unusual feature of this pair of prints is the full-frontal positioning of the figures. The two generals Yuchi Gong and Qin Qiong guard four boys clustered around their oldest brother, who rides the mythical beast known as the qilin. The five boys, educated by their strict father, Imperial Advisor Dou Yi (active 950–970), all passed the imperial civil examinations.

This painting features two contrasting techniques: the rocks were each created with a single broad expressive brushstroke while the flowers were created with relatively fine ink outlines and filled with bright colors. This combination is unusual. Most Chinese paintings of bird and flower motifs fall into one of two broad groups according to the technique employed to create them: Paintings in the xieyi style are more expressive and feature more spontaneous brushwork, as with the rocks here; paintings in the gongbi style are more carefully done with fine outlines often filled with color, as with the flowers here. The differences in these two styles are more than just technical, however. The xieyi style is associated with artists of the educated elite, while the gongbi style is associated with professional and court artists. Since members of the educated elite considered professional and court painters mere artisans, the styles were rarely mixed. Born in Shandong province in northeastern China, Guo Yizong was first influenced as an artist by his father, Guo Weiqu, who, like so many artists of his generation, had studied with Huang Binhong (1865–1955).

Later Ye Gongchao, Ye Yanlan's great grandson, added a much longer inscription that records the history of the piece in the family's collection. Gongchao recalls first seeing the title of the work at age six, when his father supervised him in copying the list of artworks in the collection. Gongchao then recounts that the family lost four trunks of paintings and calligraphy, one of which contained this piece, as they fled Beijing during the chaos at the fall of the Qing dynasty. He saw the piece again in 1927 at a birthday party where it was shown by one of the guests. Gongchao told his mother about this, and she shared more words of her late husband: that the handscroll had been assembled from fragments of Fu Shan's drafts by Fu's pupils. Gongchao eventually acquired the piece by trading a work by a later artist. This handscroll collects in a single work the various styles of calligraphy Fu Shan employed; it includes examples of standard (kaishu), clerical (lishu), seal (zhuanshu), semicursive (xingshu), and cursive (caoshu) scripts. Consisting of thirty handwritten pages of poetry, verse, and informal essays and other prose, this scroll also exemplifies Fu's range as an author.

The character-like forms resemble ancient Chinese seal script and are created with ink, the material used by scholars to chronicle history. However, they are not readable words—they are pseudocharacters invented by the artist. They follow a certain logic: Gu devised basic forms labeled A through H, then created many numbered variations in each category. Yet, despite being systematic, the shapes are empty of meaning, offering a void instead of a word and silence instead of sound. Gu developed these characters while considering the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein’s work on language and its inability to convey meaning.

Of particular note are certain ceramic wares used specifically for sculpture: Dehua, Zhangzhou, Shiwan, and Yixing wares, all named for and characteristic of the places in which they were made. Dehua wares, known in the West since the 1700s as blanc de Chine (“China white”), were produced in Dehua, in southeastern China’s Fujian province. Technical improvements achieved in the 1500s for obtaining and purifying the milk-white glaze and ivory-white clay made possible the sculpting of large figures in porcelain. Zhangzhou wares—those attributed to the Zhangzhou kiln, also in Fujian province—are distinctive for their crackled ivory-colored glaze. The Shiwan kilns at Foshan, Guangdong province in southern China produced wares with thick bodies and colorful glazes, especially known in the West as flambé (suffused) glazes. Sculptural figures and architectural ceramics are particularly significant in Shiwan ware. Clay found at Yixing, Jiangsu province in southeastern China was used to create ceramics in a characteristic range of dark colors—from brown, purple, and green to buff and beige. Yixing ceramics are known to enhance the color, fragrance, and taste of tea; therefore, the majority of Yixing ware is in the form of tea sets.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/3986/preview,"H. 3 in x W. 2 3/4 in x L. 13 in, H. 7.62 cm x W. 6.98 cm x L. 33 cm",,,2000.4.a-.b,,,,,Teapot in the shape of a bamboo boat

Section 1東池元夜
東池元夜月，故為寓人青。樹影冰塘靜，綃生淡墨娉。群兒嬉火塔，立我得漁亭。紅葉松扉小，僧燈應未扃。

Section 2七亘老杏
厓邊紅瑟瑟，老杏懶於開。悔不斧斤斷，便隨時令摧。眾憐春色冷，獨敬傲枝才。對酒不成醉，原非狂藥媒。

Section 3東池得家信依右玄寄韻
紫水舊榆城，悲凉水木楹。畫蘭難畹地，識字即瓜坑。池洑萍魚遠，花稍麻鵲輕。家書顛倒讀，有淚不知傾。
       
Section 4題陳十右玄買得韓雨公所藏管畫
名畫滿兵市，貪夫賁育構。管紙淡無色，不顧慮難售。一士非新人，識自水園舊，見之動金石，饑餓忘前後。易歸意何得，似在園主遘。俗奴殊此義，真假滋疵咎，或復貌賞識，感傷為管瘦。手捫心代驚，幸畫無情竇。願言為畫謝，憐儂無地受。即使真有情，娉婷從少疚。砧藁嫁兩翰，習見未為垢。尚悔减紅綠，令人不騖走。今歸故人笥，得無怨側陋。

Section 5雨
可惜清明雨，濛濛及此都。誣教田舍老，真作旱雲蘇。羞客深垂笠，臨岐懶問途。春光難著眼，花栁不如無。

Section 6自顧
自顧亦何陋，乾坤雜我廬。星河照雙淚，騷楚異三閭。偃卧常蒙袂，何門可曳裾？壺觴愁不解，悔讀古今書。

Section 7賤殺
賤殺栁顏厚，不知春屬誰。臨風弄新翠，倒影翳清池。意自能張緒，觀縱不漢儀，快心須一劍，砍卻看平夷。

Section 8願旱二首
雨浸人心熄，旱燒冀復燃。燒之竟不熱，心臭腥寥天。願訴祝融帝，火龍揮三千。烈焰吐一世，熸此汚邪原。大地見高明，菑金頌聖賢。皇天知好生，安用禽獸填？烈哉伯益勳，上帝俞其炎。桓宣記有年，孔子尚不然。
吾度夷齊心，不惡肥遺蛇。神州不生草，誰當有室家。釆釆首陽薇，豈能獨萌芽。樂哉無可食，早死心魂嘉。
    夏五過黃玉、黃土之師賈生，思卧，黄±具秋簟，樓外請賈生小憩。予戲曰：是謂曬尸，以師尸同聲。賈生冏，忌不吉語，遽起不卧。吾便便據之有詩遣憤。
日夕直沔死，涕零吊屈時。哥舒誅既晚，魏勝起何其。枕簟高樓敝，河山決眥窺。此生無可用，偃仰曬吾尸。

Section 9題昌穀堂字，率意所及多蔓，不責侖昚
一舞而見殺，有唐食馬報。歌工聲如雷，霹靂哀號叫。王鄭高才士，忍死戴紗帽。貴賤義懸紇，顛倒憤懷抱。不謂工書王，XX邀賊笑。不負臨寫池，絳碑就將造(府《寶賢堂帖》傳云摹自《絳帖》)。始知北地王，衒技少可耀。不然何無俚，淒涕哭宗廟。朽材分溝斷，翻譽為忠孝。百能即有濟，天受此墨妙。兒子習琵琶，指備身口道。所利有大小，得計則同調。宜乎略有能，惟嫌不冶躍，戴絃不輕鼓，老迂昧窽導。雲林重寫人，防人或有肖。貧道簡金石，念茲仰高蹈。作字如作人，亦惡帶奴貌。試看魯公書，心畫自孤傲。生死不可迴，豈為亂逆要。老倪真侷僵，未但言論峭。糞船而燒香，不受張吳召。

Section 10 悼古遺二首 
龍渊歸匣蚤，剸斷未成風。慨有籌邊志，長虛定遠功。胼胝殘邑調，痛哭夕郎封。未斂元龍氣，憎來田舍翁。
卜館寒氊破，袁山春座融。重貽朋友怨，羞與若疊同。髯戟無容冶，官輕有仆忠。規容田畫填，一簡射狐雄。
    曹子歷三縣，皆殘破治有聲。壬午冬，選兵科，差堅清上谷，復命稱旨。上疏請巡閱九邊要塞，以長城自許。未幾，卒始終以豪氣不除，為鄉里所忌。貧道有書遣曹公，諫官當言天下第一事。不月，曹子露章劾首輔，周廷儒罷相。

Section 11七賢祠(七賢者趙宣子、韓厥、程嬰、公孫杵臼、鉏麑、靈轍提、 彌明)
疏柏糅高楸，哀陰古祠假。簡樸貌七子，看目光進野。宣孟顏不舒，受法無以寫。韓子矜而恭，意注舉我者。腷臆哉彌明，殺獒怒未解，桑餓釋菜色，報德果然也。還顧觸槐人，恬然嗔怨寡。公孫死既烈，豊温像安暇。為易事已了，道腴自閒雅，肅容禮程公。癯惨神獨冷，保孤終下報，憂瘁量難舍。惻惻流離子，淚酹無孟斝。乾坤此何時，七尺未狗馬。龍髯不及攀，前星暗天下。亭毒三百年，寰海盡聾啞。草莽唯一 死，死恐未蕭洒，仰天看怒雲，驚如義旗哆。
祠僧患風不能禮客，既令其徒以筆硯留題，貧道怪其意。曰：聞名能詩。許再復之，因自嘆有作。
毛錐不殺賊，吟情附雙淚。男兒生何為，壯業雕蟲蔽。悲壯浣花老，顛躓雍梁際。忠憤發全聲，誰識此翁志。當年事如何，哥舒失險備。上皇樂游覽，八駿馭西轡。翠葆駐蠶叢，百靈擁先帝。靈武正飛龍，四海仰新制。行在尚可達，不負間關致。元勳推郭李，河山破復易。口號記天誅，劍外喜收薊，哀哉生不辰，英雄遁何地。絕裾懲太真，棲棲尸饔計。知名不賞藥，月露遂成祟。投筆起新聲，雄劍為誰礪？老衲好客詩，七字知客意。
        
Section 12聊以復祠僧二首
身隱文焉用，山僧乃勸詩。顧瞻七子貌，蕭索五城詩。苦柏神壇暗，秋陰天意悲。此中題不得，羞殺壯夫為。
老衲亦知否，七人不盡賢。鈞衡容逆賊，神笏愧香煙，獨有雙忠烈，餘皆一節全。李公碑贊好，斟酌序當年(祠有李公濂二碑，一記七贊)。
       
 Section 13悼赤城兄( 赤城，唯王孫，城破投玄通觀前井死)
落落憶朱霞，天空芳草涯。少年知赴國，勇死痛遺家。清冽琳宮井，深沉玉樹花。衰翁持病母，誰與濟兵笳。
         
Section 14頓村舅家作
老屋簪弱櫃，中霄月漏亮。四壁翠莓衣，稱吾窮宅相。須眉負日月，凍餓死何悵！漢季一寒貧，無聊與友尚。華屋豈不宜，魂夢亦羞傍，匈奴何與漢，為家耻大將。
    
Section 15小樓
小樓秋暑歇，片席寐無聰。袖許高雲度，艱難尺土踪，夢廻赤帝劍，書落白榆風。幾個陀羅樹，亭亭到眼中。
    
Section 16間關上陀羅山二首
東海西崑未得過，秋風吹落上陀羅。陸離雲粉冰晴雪，菡蓞巒蕤演石波。一撮緇新書劍卷，九原封舊涕洟多，桃源直處忘情士，處士陶潛奈若何。
南峯落落不多松，濤冷新秋帶石洶。黄面思惟悲大地，白衣客子嘯長風。崗巒龍舞英雄眼，日月烏號夢寐中。千里神州無好聽，老僧雙耳妙能聾。
        
Section 17追悼曹子二首。向與居實論甲申閣部之師，曹子苦在必請纓，誓死以信奇節，必不容其觀望不前也。因有此作。
沃相滹沱望，参軍巾幗瞠。古遺若未死，雄志必先鳴。桃劍揮猿臂(曹長臂)，妖欃怯虎旌。井陘單騎出，誰敢不駪征？
可惜一腔血，無由灑戰場。固関迴晋鄙，朱亥不從行。骨冷金臺雪，魂飛白簡霜。無衣賦雲表，哭訴九頭閶。

The last colophon on this piece was written by a Cantonese named Hanmu. It states that Ye Gongchuo collected this piece in 1916 and asked Hanmu to write a colophon on it. Not until a year later, though, when he was inspired by his studio's surroundings, did Hanmu actually write this colophon. Sitting in the studio on a rainy autumn day, enjoying antiques nearby and green pine trees outside, Hanmu felt his world was the remote peaceful ""peach blossom village"" described by the poet Tao Qian (365–427). The political turmoil that marked the end of the Ming dynasty forced Fu Shan to flee in 1644 to a village in northwest China, hundreds of miles from his home. This period of exile was to last through 1652. As an expression of his grief, sorrow, and anger, Fu wrote seventeen short pieces in various styles; all seventeen are preserved in this handscroll.

In this painting by the Shanghai-born artist Wu Tong, an elderly man standing on a protruding bluff holds two hands together as if paying respect to some natural phenomena. His walking stick is carried by a young servant behind him. The remoteness of the scenery is suggested by the faraway mountains and few birds flying in the expansive sky. Wu closely followed traditions in depicting the high mountains prevalent in classical works, yet his own inclination toward expressing the profound, solemn aspects of humanity is clearly present. He employed a range of brushwork and textures, from the thin mists in the clouds to heavily textured rocky hillocks. The figures’ natural poses are delicately executed with light strokes.

Certain of these gatherings became favored topics for literature and the visual arts. This painting depicts one such gathering. It was hosted by Su Shi (Su Dongpo 1037–1101), and it included sixteen of the best-known artists, poets, and calligraphers of his time. It came to be known as the Elegant Gathering in the Western Garden and has been a favored topic among Chinese artists since shortly after it occurred. Wei sets the theme in a garden surrounded by water, rocks, banana trees, and plants. The sixteen scholars are arranged in groups from left to right: two are deeply involved in a discussion of Taoism; two stand by a rock (the one painting on the rock is Su Shi, the host); six, either sitting or standing by a stone table, are reading and composing poetry; four are enjoying paintings and antiques; and two are playing music (one plays a piba, a type of lute), at the far right. There are also two female maids and three servant boys. Inscription Wei inscribed this work on one side of the fan and created the painting on the opposite. In his inscription he notes his admiration for Song dynasty (960–1279) paintings and literature and says they inspired his work. He identifies the figure in a yellow Taoist robe as Su Shi.

The large embroidered thangka (cat. no. 29) is an example of the types of Tibetan Buddhist work created at the imperial workshops, as is this pair of lacquered sutra covers. The covers are constructed in the traditional shape of wooden covers made to protect Tibetan religious manuscripts. The core is made of closely fitted blocks of costly white sandalwood. Each cover is elaborately decorated with gold-filled incised designs (qiangjin) on the top surface and four edges. The surface design consists of four of the Eight Auspicious Buddhist Symbols flanking a central vase with three flaming jewels. Two lotus stems issue from the central vase, each splitting into two lotus blossoms and forming pedestals for a wheel, victory standard, double fish, and vase on the top cover, and the umbrella, conch, lotus, and endless knot on the bottom cover, all amidst an elaborate floral scroll. The central panels are decorated with two borders, one of single lotus blossoms, and the other of lotus petals. The edges are filled with lotus and leaf scrolls. One end of each cover is decorated with a monster mask, the masks oriented in opposite directions to signal which cover is meant as the top and which as the bottom. The reverse of the top cover is incised with a single lotus petal on top of a lotus base; the area inside the petal is engraved with a bilingual Tibetan and Chinese table of contents, the engraved lettering filled with traces of lapis and turquoise pigments. This pair of covers once protected volume 14 of the Prajnaparamita Sutra, which is part of the Tibetan canon (Kanjur). An article in the Chinese archaeology journal Wenwu (1985, no. 9, pp. 85 – 88) describes the discovery in Tibet of two block-print editions of the Kanjur commissioned by the Yongle emperor in 1410, one set in the Potala Palace and another set at Sera Monastery. Ming records note that the emperor presented religious texts to visiting Tibetan religious leaders between 1413 and 1417; sets of the 1410 Kanjur are believed to have been among these texts. The Kanjur set presented by the Yongle emperor in 1413 to Kuntapa, head of the Sakya sect in Tibet, was fitted with sutra covers of this elaborate and sumptuously gilded design.

The plum, a symbol of the faithfulness of Confucian scholars, is a common subject in Chinese painting. The artist adapted an early version by Gai Qi (1774–1829), who had intensively studied classical figure paintings. Here, a slender, richly attired woman stands radiant before plum trees. Her fur cape protects her from the chilly atmosphere, which is masterfully conveyed through the presence of fog wafting through the trees. The backdrop of plum trees is as important as the collecting of flowers in this scene. The artist focused on creating a winter scene by rendering moisture and clouds floating around the plums. The tiny pinkish flowers enhance the delicate atmosphere of the season. From 1500 onwards, the subject of plum-picking expanded from traditionally featuring only male scholars to including female figures. The artists’ choice to depict women collecting plum flowers reflected the increasingly popular notion that the flower’s color and form were akin to that of a woman’s appearance.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/52364/preview,"H. 50 5/16 in x W. 12 11/16 in, H. 127.8 cm x W. 32.2 cm (image); H. 53 1/16 in x W. 15 1/16 in, H. 134.8 cm x W. 38.3 cm (overall)",,,2018.57,China,,,,Collecting Plum Flowers in Winter

Like his teacher Ju Lian (1828–1904), Chen Shuren favored the traditional genre of bird-and-flower painting.

Xiao painted this flower of spring in the fall of 1965, on the Double Ninth Festival—the ninth day of the ninth month of the lunar year, a day on which the Chinese go to the mountains and drink chrysanthemum tea while thinking about loved ones. Feeling a desire to experience the cold, inspired by viewing the plum blossom, Xiao Ru climbed up snowy rocks and went to worship at a temple. Next to the plum tree by the temple, Xiao expresses his wish “to sweep the country of humiliation along with the flowers of the spring season.” Unlike the usually orderly, organized layout of plum trees, the plums here stretch out wildly, with branches twisted or intermingled, an approach Xiao probably chose to better express a feeling of anxiety.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/22677/preview,"H. 65 1/2 in x W. 35 1/8 in, H. 166.4 cm x W. 89.2 cm (image); H. 110 1/2 in x W. 36 1/8 in, H. 280.7 cm x W. 91.8 cm (overall)",,,B66D5,,,,,Plum Blossoms

In 1969 Liu embarked on a new artistic phase. Influenced by photographs of the Earth and the moon sent back from the Apollo 7 mission, he began to incorporate circles and spheres into his already abstract compositions. The Which is Earth? series was created in the first year of Liu's ""space painting"" period (1969–1972). During this period he created some three hundred works in virtually the same style, the only variations being the choice of colors and the quantity and size of the circles.

Huang Jun noted that the original work on silk by Qian Xuan was collected by a Japanese person named Ōhara Ryūrō (太原流郎)….The work was originally identified as Huanye King 桓野王 which, judging by her appearance, is impossible, so now it is simply A Court Lady. Fifteen years ago I merely copied the work in outline, adding color later. …as time goes by, things have gone up and down.

The liberal environment around the Tang court gave rise to women with power and freedom, in many circumstances equal to that of men, even replacing men in certain official roles. In the realm of fashion, women wore men’s clothes to join them in sports and entertainment. The inspiration for Huang’s image was a depiction by the renowned Qian Xuan (b. approx. 1235), which was itself likely based on a Tang-dynasty work. In this painting the figure’s long robe, black hat with two hanging straps, and golden belt with elaborate repoussé emblements, designed to be a uniform for a male official, is worn by “a court lady but not a prince,” as noted by Huang Jun on the painting.

Its much simplified form is smoothed, with an oval head, two folded wings depicted by curved grooves stretching from the sides of the chest downward, and crescent-shaped legs slightly raised on the sides of the belly. The short beak is emphasized by the soft relief throughout the middle section of the head. There are no sharp edges nor refined lines to delineate the bird's features; rather, a careful polishing of the entire body and a characteristically streamlined form seem to have been the craftsman's pursuit. The bird image in Chinese art is an ancient one. Produced at the same time as painted representations, three-dimensional birds sculpted from clay and stone go back to the neolithic period, as witnessed in the Hemudu culture along the lower valley of the Yangzi River (5000-3000 BC) and in the slightly later Dawenkou culture (4300-2400 BC), whose bird-and-sun motif carved on ivory is thought to be the source of the primitive belief that was passed over to the Liangzhu culture, in the border zone of Zhejiang and Jiangsu (3400-2200 BC). In the northeast, around Liaoning and Inner Mongolia, the Hongshan culture (3500-2200 BC) is well known for having produced jade pendants in the shape of birds with spread wings. Scholars question whether the distribution of jade birds along the eastern coastal zone was related to the sun-bird motif of the Liangzhu culture or to the ancient myth of wild-birdmen which originated in the eastern region.

The simplified mantis has a body with two flat faces, and the narrow back edge has a slightly raised central rib. Grooves outline the facial features, the neck, legs, and the tail. There is an indentation under the front leg. Among excavated jades, mantis are not seen before the late Shang period. The published jade mantis from the Fuhao tomb demonstrates a columnar body with a waisted neck and a round head resting on disproportionally large, winding legs. 1 Coincident with other good contemporary jade work, double-outlines and shallow-relief are used on the piece. Notably grooves are carved beneath the legs, between which two perforations are designed for hanging or tying. Another extant piece at the Beijing Palace Museum, dated to the Shang, although its simple artistic style is close to that of the AAM piece, is executed in the same design with grooves and a hole under the legs as the Fuhao piece. 2 A rare specimen among Shang jade, this mantis bears special interest because of its simplicity. 1.

This cow turning its head backward has a rather flat body; only a few lines were used to indicate the horn and legs. The careful craftsmanship was focused on the narrow edge where deep grooves depict the tail and hooves. Two cone-shaped holes, drilled from above and below the front leg, are joined; inside them traces of cinnabar remain from an earlier immersion. One of the creative ideas of Shang jade carvers was the portrayal of animals turning their heads backward, as witnessed by cows, deer, and dogs found in the Fuhao tomb. 1 It is likely that such a design differed from normal formations and was probably worked by skillful jade masters for a Shang noble. The perforation of the two nostrils on the Fuhao cow indicates that the Shang people were able to till fields with cows pulled by means of a nosering. This thematic composition became the persistent model in jade art and was followed for centuries. 1. Zhongguo yuqi quanji (Collection of Chinese Jades), Hebei meishu chubanshe 1993 vol.

Its horns, eyes, ears, and legs in relief are symmetrically arranged on the body. The semi-gaping mouth is exposed with a deep indentation which is connected to a pilot hole below. The compact body resting on four legs is robust. Shallow-relief and grooves are used to achieve for a simple representation. Animals sculpted in jade were far more common during the Shang period than during the prehistoric era. The superstitious belief of the Shang people in divine animals was an ancient tradition that prevailed in the eastern region in the neolithic period. Wearing animal pendants seems to have been inspired by the belief that the essence of jade would convey the power of divine animals to the live human beings who wore the jade. Dragons, tigers, turtles, bird, and fish were of particular concern to the Shang people. Quite a lot of jade tigers in three-dimensional or plaque form have been unearthed from Shang tombs in Henan. 1 One or two holes are pierced in the back, the mouth, or the tail. Single and double lines in intaglio are employed for features and cloud patterns on the body. The three-dimensional tigers without holes, however, are different from plaque pendants in function. They are thought to have been protective creatures buried in tombs. (published: d'Argence 1977: 30) 1. Zhongguo yuqi quanji (Collection of Chinese Jade) Hebei meishu chubanshe 1993 vol.

The large central opening contrasts with the small hole framed in the tail on one side and the opened mouth on the other side. The spine ridge is incised with a row of cross patterns; the two faces of the body depict facial details and shield-shaped scales. Incised refined lines, double-outlined wide grooves, and raised line work are characteristic of the jade work of the period. As the mythic symbol of supreme, the dragon image was dominant in Shang art. Although jade dragons from Shang sites in Henan are worked in complete circles, semicircles, crescents, slightly curved, and elongated forms, 1 the form of this ring with the lower support is rare. Those excavated jade dragons with at least one perforation, and some with one or two indentations, seem to have served as components of ornaments or pendants. Shield-, cloud-, triangle-, and cross-patterns on jade dragons are often represented by double outlines. A new form on jade sculpture is seen in the openings which mostly depict the mouth of the dragon and display serrated floral panels in profile, the result of intermittent sawing. In this case, the technique of grinding patterns and sawing holes are of much help for identification. (published: d'Argence 1977: 24) 1.

The eyes, back fins, and the tail are depicted by long or short parallel lines in intaglio. A few concentric lines are visible along the fish body. Two holes, one in the mouth and the other in the tail, are drilled from two sides. The fish was one of the early motifs on jade. The example of neolithic jade fish found in the Liangzhu culture with two holes along the belly ridge indicates its use as a hanging or stringing ornament, but the form was very realistic, like a live fish. 1 This trend continued and remained the form in small scale until the Bronze Age. Shang jade fish still maintained the realistic form, but on the other hand, to economize on jade, the jade workers divided a disc into sections, and this led to the production of more fish pendants in thin, flat formations on a half, third, or smaller portion of a circle. Jade fish with two series of horizontally protruding fins on the belly was one of several styles among the late Shang fish found in the Fuhao tomb. 2 The common features of such fish are seen in the two or three holes on two ends and several concentric lines on the surface. 1.

He appears here as an elderly beggar with bulging eyes, a deformed head, and elongated ears. Li’s body had once been physically robust and attractive. What happened? According to the story, Li made a spiritual journey from earth to heaven, as was customary for Daoist meditators. While on his journey, Li Tieguai’s physical body seemed to be dead.

To apply the underglaze design, the artist paints directly on the clay body before firing and glazing. This process produces a nontoxic decoration that does not fade. The famed Chinese blue-and-white porcelain involves painting cobalt blue pigments as underglaze decoration over a white clay body and applying a clear glaze on top. The cobalt turns blue upon firing. The use of cobalt reflected the influence of the Islamic world, as cobalt ores were imported from Persia during the Tang dynasty (618–907).",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/16309/preview,"H. 21 3/8 in x Diam. 9 7/8 in, H. 54.3 cm x Diam. 25.1 cm",,,B60P74,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",,,,Vase with a scene of Daoist immortals celebrating longevity

The top of this container is decorated with cranes, which symbolize longevity. Below are the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove enjoying chess and other scholarly pursuits. Although the phoenix is the king of birds, the crane symbolizes both high status and longevity. Its appearance on the badge of an official's robe signaled that the wearer was a civil servant of the first rank. A crane flying in the sky represents a wish for a rise in status. The crane together with the pine tree conveys a powerful emblem for longevity. Pairs of cranes express wishes for a bride and groom to live a long life together, so they are frequently used as a decoration on marriage gifts. When the crane (he ?), is pictured with the deer (lu ?), their names form a rebus meaning the universe or longevity. The crane also represents wisdom, and when at rest, the bird is thought to be contemplating.

The dragon has many distinct characteristics: horns like a stag, head like a camel, neck like a snake, eyes like an eagle, claws like a hawk, palms like a tiger, and ears like an ox. The mythical creatures are bearded with whiskers and typically breathe fire. Historically, there are three types of dragons; the lung, the most powerful, inhabits the sky; the hornless li lives in the ocean; and the scaly chiao dwells in marshes and dens in the ocean. The dragon symbolizes high rank and power. Perhaps as long as three thousand years ago, it became the emblem of kings and emperors. The dragon also signifies benevolence, and paired with the pheasant, forms a popular wedding motif, emblematic of a perfect marriage. The dragon embodies yang (male) forces and the phoenix yin (female) forces.

The reflection refers to the illusory and temporal nature of all phenomena in the human world.

Here, Avalokiteshvara is dressed as an Indian prince in a fluid garment with crossed sashes, scarves, and a necklace on his bare chest.

Showing a confident calmness, this deity fluidly presents his mercy over the suffering of humans and efficaciously consoles the souls of his devotees. This statue may once have sat on a rocky base in the altar of a monastery, similar to the one in the photo.

In the past, China's agricultural population worshipped the dragon because of its ability to control the rains in the sky. The dragon has many distinct characteristics: horns like a stag, head like a camel, neck like a snake, eyes like an eagle, claws like a hawk, palms like a tiger, and ears like an ox. The mythical creatures are bearded with whiskers and typically breathe fire. Historically, there are three types of dragons; the lung, the most powerful, inhabits the sky; the hornless li lives in the ocean; and the scaly chiao dwells in marshes and dens in the ocean. The dragon symbolizes high rank and power. Perhaps as long as three thousand years ago, it became the emblem of kings and emperors. The dragon also signifies benevolence, and paired with the pheasant, forms a popular wedding motif, emblematic of a perfect marriage.

Painted surface affixed with silver or gold foil decors, or embellished with varied pigments covering engraved areas. Carved lacquer (tiqi), a method that involves carving built-up layers of thinly applied lacquer into a three-dimensional design. It includes techniques of carved red, carved black, and carved multicolor. “Filled-in” (xiangqian), a technique in which lacquer is inlaid with other materials. Several methods gradually evolved: filled-in gold ( qiangjin ), filled-in lacquer of different colors ( tianqi ), mother-of-pearl inlay (qianluodian), and semi-precious stone inlay ( qianbaibao ). In particular, the art of inlaying lacquer with mother-of-pearl was intensively developed during the Song era; it was also introduced to Korea and reached new apexes there (see related works in the Korean galleries). “Polish-reveal” (moxian), a method in which lacquer of one or more colors is repeatedly applied in certain areas, sometimes with a layer of gold or silver powders, to build up a design. After the ground is covered with lacquer of a new color, the entire surface is polished down to reveal the color variations and hidden patterns. This technique was introduced to Japan and developed into the famous maki-e tradition there (see related works in the Japanese galleries).",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/59678/preview,"H. 4 1/2 in x Diam. 4 3/4 in, H. 11.4 cm x Diam. 12.1 cm",,,1997.5.a-.h,China,Western Han period (206 BCE-9 CE),,,Cosmetics box set

The figure is remarkable for her strong outline and heroic quality in the blizzard. Her identity is clear from the shoulder bag with a prominent red cross. A sense of strength and determination is conveyed through her confident stride, clutched fist, and encouraged face, as well as through Huang’s sketching, rendered in austere brushwork. In contrast, the camel that looms like a shadow directly behind her is rendered in soft, blurry ink washes. A phenomenon of the Cultural Revolution, barefoot doctors were physicians serving rural areas. Many were farmers or workers who had received rudimentary training before starting practice. An artist in favor of socialist realism, Huang Zhou developed a fascination with the working classes and ethnic minorities living in China’s northwestern border provinces such as Xinjiang, and his paintings often vividly captured the life and environment in the frontiers.

Some time between 1591 and 1600 he moved to Nanjing, where his talent was noted by members of the imperial court. There he had access to ancient paintings in the imperial collection. Perhaps in part due to this exposure, Wu was a leader in a movement to revive the traditional styles of the Song dynasty (960–1279). Although he was accomplished in a range of styles and types of painting, he is now best known for monumental landscapes with exaggerated compositions and forms, characteristics of a painting tradition associated with the Northern Song dynasty (960–1126). This very large hanging scroll, no doubt created for one of the palatial-sized buildings common in Nanjing, is a creative reworking of the late Ming revival of the monumental landscape painting, with its emphasis is on vertical rock forms.

The upturned mouth is harmonious with the bifurcated tail. The fish is simply incised with round eyes, gills outlined by a pair of lines, a long fin on the back and two shorter fins on the belly, all are represented by dense parallel short lines. A perforation is placed on the upper gill. Not only did Shang jade fish vary in shapes, functions, and decorations on the body, but their compositional themes were manifold. The straight fish forms from the Fuhao tomb appear to have been used as knives and earpicks in addition to the traditional function as ornaments. [1] The depiction of fish was rendered as with round eyes worked by single or double outlines, a single line of fins on the back and two friezes of short fins on the belly, and a forked or straight ended tail. One or two perforations were executed as the indication of the mouth or tail ends. Western-Zhou jade carvers generally inherited the Shang's manner of depicting fish, as many straight-bodied fish have been unearthed from Western Zhou tombs. [2] (published: d'Argence 1977: 28) 1.

That is probably the case with this sword slide or guard. The decoration on the front surface is consistent with a late Warring States or early Western Han date. It features linked comma patterns and other curvilinear devices, some with fine parallel lines incised over them. Also typical of the period, the surface is highly polished. However, the back section of the piece is in an entirely different. It is crudely finished with only cursory lines incised to suggest a vague reference to the earlier designs. It is also far to round in shape to have served successfully as a sword slide. It has been suggested that this piece is a fragment that was re-cut sometime shortly after the end of the Han dynasty into a traditional shape. The exact date of the re-cutting cannot be precisely determined but it might be as early as the third or fourth century. The exact nature of the original piece is hard to determine. It was not much wider than its current form but must have been somewhat longer. At one end are the eyebrows, eyes, and the beginnings of the snout of a dragon. The piece must have been long enough to accommodate the remainder of the dragon and perhaps more. It was also fairly thick. This piece is cut from grayish tan Khotan jade with darker cloudy areas at one end. Both the level of finish and polish on the front side are very high. The back is very rough and is not polished. Staining and adhesions of iron imprinted with textile patterns on the back of this piece indicate that it served as a fitting for an iron sword when it was buried and that it was a treasured piece. 1.

As Rawson points out, these objects were fairly common in certain early to middle Neolithic cultures, but seem to have vanished during the late Neolithic, only to reappear some 1000 or more years later during the early Eastern Zhou (Rawson, p. 243). She also suggests that the Eastern Zhou examples were conscious copies of Neolithic prototypes, and that these earlier pieces had survived to serve as models. The exact function of these objects also remains somewhat of a mystery. Archaeological evidence indicates that the Neolithic jue was most commonly an earring. However, the Eastern Zhou version with its long profile and narrow opening could serve this function only in a very awkward fashion. The opening also makes it difficult to imagine how such a piece could function as a bead for suspending a pendant; any line passing through it would easily escape through the long slot. Rawson suggests that the flattened version of the jue was used in conjunction with a shroud in the changing burial practices of the Eastern Zhou period (Rawson, p. 243). This is consistent with the location of these objects in burials. It is possible that the more tubular version served a similar function. Much of the jade of this jue has been altered by burial and is cloudy white in color. However, there is an area on one side that is not altered and reveals the tan-colored stone from Khotan found in many Western Zhou pieces. The decoration consists of curvilinear patterns created by pairs of parallel lines and ending in a small circular motif. Small independent circles are also found between the larger motifs. Many of the linear patterns contain traces of red, no doubt the remains of cinnabar powder which was used in Chinese burials as early as the Neolithic period.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/15165/preview,H. 1 1/16 in,,,B60J847,China,Spring and Autumn period (770-476 BCE),,,Slit bead (jue)

For the first time in Chinese history a genuinely urban middle class was emerging. During the Song dynasty, dishes and vessels for household use were commonly ceramics.

The result here is rich and dark, with strong tonal contrasts. This sense of form, in which the artist models forms with light and shade as well as a suggestion of atmosphere and depth, points to an awareness of European art. Gong Xian was active in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, where Jesuit missionaries were a presence starting in the early 1600s. A number of Gong's paintings suggest his knowledge of the illustrated books these missionaries carried with them. For Gong, landscape painting served as a physical and psychological retreat from everyday reality, specifically the turmoil in the period from the end of the Ming dynasty through the establishment of the Qing. Artist's biography: Gong Xian was originally from Kunshan, also in Jiangsu province. He is considered one of the Eight Masters of Jinling (the ancient name for Nanjing). He was active in scholarly and political as well as art circles. Near the end of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) he was associated with a group of scholars in and around Nanjing who attempted to reform the decaying Ming government. After the fall of city to the Manchus, Gong refused to serve the foreign-ruled government of the Qing dynasty and spent much of his time in seclusion in his garden in Nanjing (the former Ming capital), making some income from selling his paintings. Interested in painting theory, history, and practice, Gong was not modest about his work, claiming that ""landscapes [as good as mine] have never been seen in times before me and will not be seen in times after me.""",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/57575/preview,"H. 60 1/2 in x W. 20 3/8 in, H. 153.7 cm x W. 51.8 cm (image); H. 104 1/4 in x W. 28 1/4 in, H. 264.8 cm x W. 71.8 cm (overall)",,,B69D54,,,,,View of Qixia

Luo Pin’s personal interpretation has Master Zhang dressed as a Daoist immortal: he wears a ceremonial robe worn by a priest officiating at a ritual, with a tablet in his hands. Written during a Dragon Boat Festival held to wipe out misfortunes, Luo’s playful poem describes the subject: “If one method of magic does not give results, he uses another. In this old man’s sleeves there are millions of magical tricks. If [my pictures] could really bring in gold, all households would invite me to paint images of bodhisattvas.

It was painted early in Wang's career for one of the most influential art patrons of his time. While in his short inscription Wang feigned indifference, it is obvious he was aware of the possible importance of this painting, which has since been recognized as the major masterpiece of his early career. It is difficult to comprehend the amount of work and skill that went into creating this long handscroll (you are seeing only a short section here). It begins with a densely painted mountain passage whose execution required almost every skill in the painters' repertoire, and goes on through alternating sections of open waterways and mountains.

This painting by Chen Dayu is an example, in which plum branches are placed around the large rooster occupying most of the picture. An image of a squawking rooster is traditionally considered a sign of celebration and good luck. Here, its upturned head is vividly rendered with a few strokes and brilliant red color, drawing attention to its posture and open beak. Surrounding the rooster are viridian-dyed plums, outlined in ink, to emphasize the bird’s form and add impact to the picture. Chen started his career as an apprentice to his first art instructor, Qi Baishi (1863–1957), who had a nationwide reputation as a painter of flower-and-bird pictures with graceful lines. However, Chen’s rooster bears no resemblance to Qi’s work; his bird, rendered in thick, loose brushstrokes, is characteristic of his unique style.

In this composition, Huang employed a freehand approach to ink and brush when depicting donkeys in varied positions and from different perspectives. With minimal brushstrokes, Huang managed to render the vivid appearances of the donkeys and capture the lively feeling of their movements.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/6018/preview,"H. 37 1/4 in x W. 17 3/8 in, H. 94.6 cm x W. 44.1 cm (image); H. 71 in x W. 26 3/4 in, H. 180.3 cm x W. 67.9 cm (overall)",,,2005.91,,,,,Donkeys

When the Song state stood on the verge of destruction by the nomadic Nuzhen, Zhao Ding openly advocated the use of force against the invasion. His opponents, led by Qin Kuai who belonged to a powerful court faction, caused him to be demoted. Eventually Zhao chose to die by hunger strike, thus demonstrating his dedication to safeguarding the Song dynasty. Years later, the new emperor Xiaozong (reigned 1163–1189) restored Zhao’s reputation and granted him the posthumous title Faithful Being. In this painting Zhao Ding stands in a dignified pose, presenting a tablet hu, a kind of ritual scepter, as though at the imperial court. The damaged, incomplete inscription verifies that this portrait was intended to commemorate his name being entered in the official annals. Details of his striking multiridged black hat, and the full-length brocade robe with strings of pearls and jade pendants suspended from the side, provide invaluable firsthand insight into the formal court uniform code of the Tang and Song dynasties. This is an extremely rare official portrait belonged to the Mongol Yuan period or even earlier. Dubosc owned this work and lent it to the famous 1968 Yuan exhibition at the Cleveland Museum. Sherman Lee and Wai-kam Ho believed this work was commisioned around 1331 when a local shrine was built to commemorate this paragon when the infleuence of Neo-Confucianism spread across northern China. Dubosc later sold this work to Brundage.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/60867/preview,"H. 69 1/8 in x W. 33 in, H. 175.6 cm x W. 83.8 cm (image), H. 116 in x W. 40 3/8 in, H. 294.6 cm x W. 102.6 cm (overall)",,,B70D3,China,Yuan dynasty,Chinese,,Portrait of Lord Zhao Ding

images/asian_chinese1132.jpg,The Avery Brundage Collection,,Nephrite,,,,Not on view,Chinese Art,,,,Jade And Stones,,,Western Han period (206 BCE-9 CE),"Ritual and burial objects of some scale began to appear in increasing numbers during of the Warring States period and on into the Western Han. Most common among these was the bi . The reasons for this increase at least in part can be attributed to a combination of economic factors, greater access to material from Hetian (Khotan), and changes in funerary practices. Funerary paintings of the Western Han period depict the bi as part of an ensemble tied together with cords. Bi are shown on the two painted silk banners from tombs number I and III at Mawangdui, Changsha, with two dragons entwined through the central opening and with a triangular ornament suspended from the bi by a cord with tassels. A bi in the Seattle Art Museum similar to the example under discussion actually has discolored areas showing where such cords would have passed through it. It is thought that these ensembles were placed on top of coffins and played an important role in Han funerary practices. The hexagonal pattern, known as the rush or matting pattern in Chinese literature, is commonly found on jade bi of the Western Han period. It is created by a series of lines cut at angles. The first stages of creating the ""sprouting grain"" pattern may have been identical; thus this decoration is a simplified version of a more complex and time consuming earlier pattern. This again may suggest a change in attitude toward the objects created from jade and may also suggest that theywere intended only for burial. This piece is quite thin and is cut from a piece of yellowish Khotan jade. Unlike many thin-cut pieces from earlier periods, the two sides here are exactly parallel and even. This suggests some further advances in the saws used to cut the raw stone. There are two areas of significant staining and alteration of the stone and some suggestions of veining or flaws. The overall surface is mottled with areas of white. 1. Shang Zhitan, ""Mawangdui yihao Han mu 'feiyi'shishi"" (An Interpretation of the ""feiyi"" [painting] from the Han Tomb no.

images/asian_chinese1134.jpg,The Avery Brundage Collection,,Nephrite,,,,Not on view,Chinese Art,,,,Jade And Stones,,,,"Agate is relatively rare in burials of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods and seems to appear in a select group of objects. This rather odd shaped object is an example of one type of implement that seems to have been almost exclusively from this medium. Comparable to this piece is a pair from the late Spring and Autumn period tombs at Taiyuan in Shanxi province. Similar pieces have been found in Shandong. They are described as dragon-shaped ornaments, with the small protrusion along the bottom of the piece serving as the dragon's leg. The suspension hole drilled in the center of these pieces would indicate that they served as part of a pendant. They have been found in coffins near the skeleton, most often close to the legs or even the feet of the deceased, suggesting that they were suspended low on the body. Similar to jade, agate is a hard stone that cannot be easily carved; however, it does not have jade's fibrous structure and is actually quite brittle and often filled with veins or flaws. Thus it is quite difficult to create any detail on the surface of an agate object. The examples found in Chinese tombs of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods are often relatively simple shapes with high polishes, little if any surface decoration and sharply defined edges. Agate is much more translucent than jade, and that is certainly the case with this piece which approaches transparency. The stone has a very slight brown tinge with fine cloud-like areas dispersed throughout. 1. Fung, p. 180 2. Zhongguo Yuqi Chuanji , vol 3, p. 28, plate 44 3. Kaogu , 1964, no. 2, p. 135, no. 10 4.

The modeling is a bit flat but smooth, and makes a perfect fondling piece. The catfish is called nianyu in Chinese, a pun for ""year"" and ""abundance."" Two catfish by themselves represent the auspicious phrase nian nian you yu, or ""abundance year after year."" The larger fish carries a bifurcating branch with two heads of grain, one appearing on the side, the other below. The grain is a symbol for a bumper harvest, while the two catfish are homophonous with ""year."" The motif thus represents niannian fengshou, or ""bumper harvest year after year."" In other example of the catfish motif (see cat. no.), they can be carrying the wish-granting fungus, forming the rebus for niannian ruyi, or ""may your wishes come true year after year.""

As a young man he was discovered in Suzhou by members of the educated elite, some of whom served as his teachers, others as his patrons. Contact with the educated elite allowed Qiu access to ancient paintings in their collections.

Tao Yuanming [Tao Qian, 365–427] of the Jin dynasty
was an accomplished scholar of Confucianism. Lu
Xiujing [406–477], the master of the six recluses,
was studying the goodness of the Way [Tao]. Great
Master [Huiyuan] was a teacher of the Buddhist
doctrine who could explain dreadful or prohibited
matters; he lived on Mount Lu. When he sent his
guests off, he would show them the way to Tiger
Stream [but would never cross it]. One day Tao and
Lu called on Huiyuan. Their conversation was so congenial
that Huiyuan crossed Tiger Stream unintentionally.
When they realized it, they all laughed
loudly. [This story] has been handed down as the
“Three Laughers.” Qieyuan, Gao Qipei, with inked
fingernails.",Painting,,,Qing dynasty (1644-1911),"By the tenth century, Tao Yuanming emerged in literary and artistic references as one of three men celebrated for their reclusive natures and buoyant spirits. Joining Tao were Lu Xiujing (406–477), a Daoist monk based in Jiankang (Nanjing), and Hui Yuan (334–416), a Buddhist monk from a temple in Mt. Lu in southeastern China. For many years Hui had never ventured beyond Tiger Stream—the other side of which was the haunt of tigers—even when walking with his two friends. One day the three, immersed in conversation, unintentionally crossed the stream and heard tigers roaring in warning. Laughing by the water, the three departed. They became known as “the three laughing men.” In this painting by Gao Qipei, Hui, flanked by Tao and Lu, stand on a hill in front of the gushing waterfall just after crossing a bridge.

These fans, when folded up, could be carried in the long, loose sleeves of gowns worn by both men and women, and casually displayed at a desired moment. Due to this casual use, such fans were prone to damage and loss; yet many have survived, suggesting the tremendous numbers that must have been created. Works by the professional artist Qiu Ying were among the most sought-after decorative paintings of the time, and the ownership of a fan by him was a symbol of wealth and sophistication. In response to this heavy demand, Qiu's workshop produced fans in tremendous numbers. Works in the same style, often with a forged Qiu Ying signature or seal, have continued to be produced to this day. Befitting their purpose, ""Qiu Ying"" fans are brightly colored and often painted on gold-covered paper.

The earliest Chinese metal vessels were created by hammering bronze into the desired shapes. The bodies of these vessels tend to be thin and their profiles exaggerated versions of earlier ceramic vessels. Later, artisans developed the technology to cast vessels by pouring the molten metal into molds. The earliest bronze vessels probably borrowed their shapes from ceramic prototypes of the late Neolithic period. Due to the nature of the material, most ceramic forms had thick bodies, rounded profiles, and few, if any, surface protrusions. This influence can be seen in the legs and overall profile of the bronze. Changes in bronze vessel forms from these rather awkward beginnings indicate their creators’ growing familiarity with the unique characteristics of the clay-mold casting process. While surface decoration became quite complex, most bronze forms remained relatively simple—either curved or square—to facilitate the release of the mold pieces. Three-dimensional additions, such as elaborate handles or functional parts of vessels, were often precast and attached to the body by one of two complicated processes. In addition to the thin band of decoration on the body of this vessel, a human mask with eyes in relief and a wideopen mouth decorates the top.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/54935/preview,"H. 8 3/4 in x W. 6 in x D. 5 1/2 in, H. 22.9 cm x W. 15.2 cm x D. 14 in",,,B60B53,"Henan province, China",,,,Ritual wine vessel (lihe)

The large, bold, and free brushstrokes used to create the vines and the bright colors used to create the flowers of the morning glory in this painting are typical of paintings of the Shanghai school. This school arose during the last half of the 1800s, when Shanghai became one of China's great port cities. The wealth of that city created a demand for bold and decorative paintings for display in their mansions, and for this purpose relatively simple but expressive ""big brush"" paintings were created in large numbers by an ever-expanding group of artists. By the early part of the twentieth century the Shanghai school had become internationally renowned. Wang Geyi was one of the last artists active in this style. He studied painting with the great master Wu Changshi (1844–1927) and was associated with other great early twentieth-century painters such as Wang Zhen (Wang Yiting, 1867–1938) and Zhang Daqian (1899–1983).

As conditions in Vietnam worsened, the number of refugees grew, ultimately reaching two million. Many braved the typhoons and traveled great distances, landing in neighboring countries in Southeast Asia. Hong Kong took in many of the floating refugees, but by 1989, more than a decade after the change of government in Vietnam, Hong Kong was encouraging many of them to return to their homeland, sparking debate over the plight of this population. At a time when the disposition of the ""boat people"" was being decided in Hong Kong, Fang Zhaoling made a series of paintings based on them. Writing the inscription from their point of view, Fang addresses their aimlessness and loss of direction, identifying with their ambiguous future perhaps because Hong Kong's citizens would soon be in a similar predicament owing to its imminent changeover in government. Born in China in 1914 Fang Zhaoling studied in Britain and the United States before settling in Hong Kong. She has studied painting under a variety of teachers: Qian Songyan, a traditionalist from Fang's native city of Wuxi; Chao Shaoan, a master of the Lingnan school; and Zhang Daqian, who sought the sources of his style in China's most ancient art. However, Fang Zhaoling developed an individual style whose distinctive features are spontaneity and an apparent naiveté. The inscription by the artist reads: Drifting along in the great big ocean, like a boat moving through the vast desert, at times getting lost, at times not knowing where I came from. I decide a direction for myself, since life matters most. The affairs of the world have changed enormously. Once I establish a direction for myself, I can avoid vacillating between two different paths.

The now completely secularized metal is used as a mere background for designs that are for the most part borrowed from other media, such as painting, and are no longer adapted to the anatomy of the containers. With the hu (B60B974), the cup belongs to a group of vessels which were first, if not exclusively, manufactured by workshops located in southern Shanxi or northern Henan. The decor. probably filled at one time with some kind of organic substance, appears now in intaglio. The collar and foot bands display diamond shapes with elongated apexes and the lower belly band a row of lappets inscribed with two variants of legless but long-necked, long-beaked and crested birds which are alternately confronted or addorsed. The main band, the most spectacular one, shows an array of animal and human figures, some big, some small, some fairly naturalistic, some fantastic, but all in profile and frequently engaged in combat. Regardless of the message they conveyed to the Chinese of the period. such violent scenes were obviously inspired by some of the main themes in the art or the Asian Steppes.

This work exemplifies the court painting tradition associated with the former Southern Song dynasty (1127– 1279). Professional painters of and outside the Ming court did not always sign their works. Not only does this make it difficult to assign paintings to individual artists, but it has historically made it easy for unscrupulous collectors and dealers to add false signatures in the attempt to raise the economic value of paintings from this time.

The earliest Chinese metal vessels were created by hammering bronze into the desired shapes. The bodies of these vessels tend to be thin and their profiles exaggerated versions of earlier ceramic vessels. Later, artisans developed the technology to cast vessels by pouring the molten metal into molds. The earliest bronze vessels probably borrowed their shapes from ceramic prototypes of the late Neolithic period. Due to the nature of the material, most ceramic forms had thick bodies, rounded profiles, and few, if any, surface protrusions. This influence can be seen in the legs and overall profile of the bronze. Changes in bronze vessel forms from these rather awkward beginnings indicate their creators’ growing familiarity with the unique characteristics of the clay-mold casting process. While surface decoration became quite complex, most bronze forms remained relatively simple—either curved or square—to facilitate the release of the mold pieces. Three-dimensional additions, such as elaborate handles or functional parts of vessels, were often precast and attached to the body by one of two complicated processes.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/59659/preview,"H. 11 1/4 in x W. 9 1/2 in x D. 10 in, H. 28.6 cm x W. 24 cm x D. 25.4 cm",,,B60B1021,China,,,,Ritual food vessel (you)

The earliest Chinese metal vessels were created by hammering bronze into the desired shapes. The bodies of these vessels tend to be thin and their profiles exaggerated versions of earlier ceramic vessels. Later, artisans developed the technology to cast vessels by pouring the molten metal into molds. The earliest bronze vessels probably borrowed their shapes from ceramic prototypes of the late Neolithic period. Due to the nature of the material, most ceramic forms had thick bodies, rounded profiles, and few, if any, surface protrusions. This influence can be seen in the legs and overall profile of the bronze. Changes in bronze vessel forms from these rather awkward beginnings indicate their creators’ growing familiarity with the unique characteristics of the clay-mold casting process. While surface decoration became quite complex, most bronze forms remained relatively simple—either curved or square—to facilitate the release of the mold pieces. Three-dimensional additions, such as elaborate handles or functional parts of vessels, were often precast and attached to the body by one of two complicated processes.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/11517/preview,"H. 13 in x W. 8 in x D. 7 1/2 in, H. 33 cm x W. 20.3 cm x D. 19.1 cm",,,B60B45,China,,,,Ritual wine vessel (jia)

Rustic villages are cradled by mountains, or built out over the water. A narrative picture unfolds from the left: in a thatched house mid-mountain, a group of three women gather to sew clothes and make yarn. At the center of the picture, two fishermen stand on the riverbank; one, with a woven-cord ladder, lifts a large, tied-up fishnet out of the water, and behind him, a young man casts a small net. Up toward the middle reaches of the river, a gentleman sits on a boat, accompanied by a young man in front of him, while a boatman at the stern pulls the oars. There is a clear contrast between the flat water and high cliffs, between crisp, sharp brushwork and soft washes and strokes.

In the 1970s she painted under the instruction of Lingnan school masters. Together they began experimenting to break free of traditional styles, moving toward abstract and expressionist modes. At the time, spaceships and satellites struck their artistic imaginations, as they offered a spectacular view of the universe. When the artist turned to spontaneous compositions in the 1980s, spirituality became an inspiration for her creativity.

Dehua wares, known in the West since the 1700s as blanc de Chine (“China white”), were produced in Dehua, in southeastern China’s Fujian province. Technical improvements achieved in the 1500s for obtaining and purifying the milk-white glaze and ivory-white clay made possible the sculpting of large figures in porcelain. Zhangzhou wares—those attributed to the Zhangzhou kiln, also in Fujian province—are distinctive for their crackled ivory-colored glaze. The Shiwan kilns at Foshan, Guangdong province in southern China produced wares with thick bodies and colorful glazes, especially known in the West as flambé (suffused) glazes. Sculptural figures and architectural ceramics are particularly significant in Shiwan ware. Clay found at Yixing, Jiangsu province in southeastern China was used to create ceramics in a characteristic range of dark colors—from brown, purple, and green to buff and beige.

The ultimate prototype for this form might be found in the bronze pan of the Shang dynasty. However, a two-fish version was more common in the Han dynasty, and examples from the Han served as models for ceramic pieces in the Northern and Southern Song periods, the Yuan, and the Ming. Qing dynasty vessels using this motif took different forms, some of which combined elements from various earlier vessel types. Several examples like this one in jade have been attributed to the Qianlong reign. One of those is a standard pan shape with a long inscription on the interior in seal script; the decor on the exterior is derived from early bronzes. The second has a more oblong shape and is inscribed with the characters for Qianlong fanggu (imitation of an archaic work made in the Qianlong era); it is made from a streaked and mottled jade.

The earliest Chinese metal vessels were created by hammering bronze into the desired shapes. The bodies of these vessels tend to be thin and their profiles exaggerated versions of earlier ceramic vessels. Later, artisans developed the technology to cast vessels by pouring the molten metal into molds. The earliest bronze vessels probably borrowed their shapes from ceramic prototypes of the late Neolithic period. Due to the nature of the material, most ceramic forms had thick bodies, rounded profiles, and few, if any, surface protrusions. This influence can be seen in the legs and overall profile of the bronze. Changes in bronze vessel forms from these rather awkward beginnings indicate their creators’ growing familiarity with the unique characteristics of the clay-mold casting process. While surface decoration became quite complex, most bronze forms remained relatively simple—either curved or square—to facilitate the release of the mold pieces. Three-dimensional additions, such as elaborate handles or functional parts of vessels, were often precast and attached to the body by one of two complicated processes.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/51328/preview,"H. 11 1/2 in x W. 7 1/2 in x D. 6 1/8 in, H. 29.8 cm x W. 17.8 cm x D. 15.6 cm",,,B60B767.a-.b,China,,,,Ritual vessel (fangyi) with lid

He often uses negative space to suggest snow, streams, mist, and clouds, creating glowing light that contrasts sharply with the darker tones of tall mountains and lush vegetation. His mountains often float in the air, without revealing tops or bottoms, thus generating a mysterious, surrealistic look. He also likes to create imaginative landscapes from unconventional shapes formed by jagged lines that twist and turn at abrupt angles.

Although she has the company of her attendant, she appears emotionally lonely and unhappy, as suggested by the poetry inscribed above. The lyric text, titled Guisi (Boudoir Lament) and compiled by the renowned female poet Li Qingzhao (1084–1155), belonged to a distinctive genre of classical Chinese literature which conveys a lady’s loneliness as she anxiously waits in the inner quarter and pines for her husband’s return. The lyrics “a thousand threads of sorrow writhing with but an inch of tender intestine” vividly portray the mood of anxiety and sadness and evoke the viewers’ empathetic response to the image. A Nanjing artist, Xu Lele renders scenes from classical novels, yet the figures appear languid and soft, sometimes naive-looking. Her distinctive style is comparable to that of the influential eccentric painter Chen Hongshou (1598–1652). Chen was particularly skilled in depicting archaistic figures with decorative colors and exaggerated, almost distorted curvy lines. Xu’s paintings often carry a bitter tinge of nostalgia or a touch of escapism from the present.

Wen Tong (aka Wen Huzhou, 1018–1079) was a key figure in this development. He discarded the popular approach of employing pigments and instead used light ink to give a sense of the essence of the plant. His paintings of bamboo, in which the plants appear to move as if blown by wind, came to be recognized as the foundation for ""the school of Huzhou bamboo,"" which had a great impact on later bamboo paintings. This simple composition is a response to a style of bamboo painting associated with Wen Tong. Ye Gongchuo states in his inscription that he painted this work from memory, a declaration that indicates he had made a profound study of Wen Tong's works. He rendered each leaf and stem with a sharp, clear edge in a single stroke, a sign of confidence and mastery; even the slightest hesitation in brush movement would have resulted in a wavering edge.

Not only does the piece bear the characters for the signature of the famous calligrapher Chu Suiliang, but also the colophons, the earliest of which is dated 916, reveal a fascinating history of this work having been collected at the very highest level. Yinfu jing can be translated as the ""Scripture of the Hidden Talisman""; it presents a view of the grand cosmic order—in very obtuse language. Allegedly a revelation from the so-called Yellow Emperor, it appears in textual references as early as the late 500s. The Yinfu jing text begins on the second leaf of this album.

The treasures were hidden in this cave sometime during the Song dynasty (960–1279), possibly as a precaution against the encroaching Western Xia army, and were forgotten. In 1908, French sinologist Paul Pelliot (1878–1945) came to Dunhuang and purchased ten truckloads of manuscripts from this trove. After his death, his wife sold this painting. Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, is shown standing upright with each of his feet supported by a lotus blossom. His raised right hand carries a sprig of willow, with which he sprinkles the nectar of life from the bottle he holds in his left hand. The bodhisattva wears a red and green robe richly adorned with jewelry and a crown bearing the seated image of his spiritual father, the Buddha Amitabha. His hair is fashioned into a chignon and a halo surrounds his head. This early representation of Avalokiteshvara depicts him wearing a thin moustache and goatee.

But ceramic technologies developed slowly over the following millennium or so, until around two thousand years ago, when kiln designs, firing temperatures, and understanding of clays and glazes reached a high point. At that time, potters in Zhejiang province in the lower Yangtze river valley were producing high-fired wares with green or brown glazes.

This is an obvious response to the shape of the actual larva. It has nine segments in addition to the head. The head has two eyes attached to the top and a protrusion most likely meant to represent the larva's legs. The small hole for suspension is located in this protrusion. The drill marks indicate it was cut from the top. In use, a series of these jade silkworms would have dangled from the main pendant cord; attached only by the small suspension hole located at the very top, they would have swung quite freely. The depiction of an insect larva in the rare and treasured material of jade might come as a surprise. However, this larva produces silk, and silk, along with jade, has long been among the most treasured of materials to the Chinese. Remains of textile patterns found on certain Shang and Zhou jades indicate that in certain situations these two materials were in close proximity in tombs. Many jade pendants in the shape of a silkworm can be dated to the Western Zhou with a several coming from established excavated sites. This silkworm is cut from a piece of light tan jade of very consistent color, is a type associated with Khotan.

A field of raised comma spirals defined by incised lines fills the exterior region, and the grid used by the carver to arrange the whorls is slightly visible. This ""sprouting grain"" pattern is the culmination of the development of textured surfaces that began with the incised dragon's head pattern. A smooth, plain border gently slopes upward and separates off the central face, which is decorated with a cloud motif consisting of three grooves, secondary incised lines and three areas of fine cross-hatching. The surface is carefully worked and finely finished. This was the standard central design on most sword pommels. Others were decorated with a four or five open petal pattern in relief or were covered by high relief dragons. The back of this piece is plain except for a circular groove. It shows the precision and workmanship characteristic of jades from the Warring States period, demonstrating the refinement of jade working techniques from earlier times. It is highly finished with a combination of order and fluidity. Sword fittings were abundant during the Warring States period because of the breakdown of central authority and the increase in political turmoil. The sword pommel was attached perpendicularly to the upper end of the sword handle. It is one of four jade military pieces for the sword -- pommel, slide, chape, and guard. Several pommels were found in the tomb of the Nanyue King in Guangzhou. The central designs on these differ, suggesting the path of development of the decor in later times. The surface of this piece has been almost totally altered by burial or other means. It is now a warm ivory with areas of light tan. Due to the opacity of the surface it is difficult to determine the quality of the stone. The level of finish is quite high, as is the polish. 1. Forsyth, plate 124 2. Rawson, 21:3 3. Fung, p. 199 4.

There are no dramatic gestures or facial expressions; the unclear, mysterious personal relationships of the five are suggested in their incongruous positions. To give them a fresh, clear aquatic background, the artist pushed trees, flowers, and distant mountains to the top of the composition.

The head is framed with curly black hair and a halo with a thick black border. It has a broad face, with arching eyebrows and lips placed close to the nose. The typical red shading around the eyes, lips, and neck give depth to the facial features in a few vital brushstrokes. Buddhism spread from India to Central Asia and China through the northern and southern branches of the Silk Road. Kucha, a royal city-state on the northern route, was a favorite stopping place for caravans and pilgrims. In the seventh century the city was a flourishing center of Buddhist studies; it was the largest monastic community in Central Asia, with more than a thousand stupas. The caves of Kucha and the surrounding cities were once filled with wall paintings. This object was found in the rubble in a high cave at the gorge entrance of Sim-sim near Kirish by the German archaeologist Albert von Le Coq (1860-1930) on the Fourth German Expedition in 1913. Le Coq excavated many sites in Xinjiang (also known as Chinese Turkistan), once removing entire walls of murals in Bezeklik Caves that were destroyed during WWII.

The head has no openwork or highly refined carving, only deep and shallow grooves to indicate the dragon's hair, horns, eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth. The line work is simple and straightforward, and the form is unusually wide and thick for a belt hook. Belt hooks of this type often have two rectangular or round horizontal slits at the base, through which a belt can pass. The slits distinguished this type from most others in which a stud on the base plugged into a hole in the belt. The new two-slit design was inspired by a Warring States Period form with a stud and a square ring on the base. The stud was inserted into a hole of a leather belt, and the belt then passed through the ring, making the hook more secure (Wang 1982, 78, fig. 5). The hook shown here retained the style of the classical Chinese mandolin piba, but its two-slit design is close to that of modern belts.

On the Path of Faith presents a procession of Tibetan monks before a large stone relief with Buddhist figures. When coming across such a relief in their travels, Tibetan monks traditionally stop and pray. The artist employed a variety of pictorial effects to both distinguish and unite the three elements of rock, relief, and humans. The four seated Buddhist figures are treated in mosaic patterns, which distinguishes them from the crosshatched rock relief. Each seated figure corresponds compositionally to one of the human figures before it. The angular planes of the monks' forms echo those of the rock, as if both humans and earth were hewn of the same material. The specific technique employed for this print is called relief etching. This entails inking only the unincised surface of the plate to create a reverse print—one with an inked background and uninked incised lines. Yang pressed all the prints by hand.

The silver cover repeats the floral scrollwork on the container and the leaf design on its base except that it has two leaves instead of one. The knob is made of jade inlaid with gold. Indians believe that silver keeps paan fresh, so it is appropriate that the jade paan container should have a silver cover (Pratapaditya Pal, personal communication).

As a larva, the cicada spends many years of its life underground. Then it emerges and sheds its case, becoming a perfect insect. To the ancient Chinese, the cicada symbolized rebirth. During the Han dynasty (206 b.c.e.–220 c.e.), it was customary to place a flat jade cicada under the tongue of the deceased. It was also an ornament for the headgear of important officials from the post-Han era up to the Ming dynasty (Watt [year?], 77).

Written in the year 757, the poem makes clear Du Fu's abiding concern for what many considered to be China's unfortunate fate. One year before, Du had left his family in an attempt to serve the exiled emperor Xuantong in the northwestern province of Ningxia. On the way Du was captured by An Lushan's troops and escorted back to the capital. Du expressed his grief in the form of laments about his captive status; it is said that during this period he lost so much hair that what was left was too thin to be held up by a hairpin. This poem reads: The nation [is] shattered, though mountains and rivers remain. The city in spring, grass and trees have grown deep. Feeling the time, even flowers draw tears. Resenting separation, even birds strain the heart. Beacon fires unstoppable through the third month, A letter from home [is] worth ten thousand in gold.

Ancient works of art with inscriptions were particularly valuable since they served not only as objects of study but also as models for creating original calligraphic styles. The Yeh family was involved with the collection and study of ancient objects and, while much of that part of the collection has been dispersed, records of objects in it are found in other forms—such as this calligraphy by Yanlan. Other artists sought to emulate early script styles or incorporate rubbings into paintings of vessels, but Ye went one step further, reproducing by hand the inscriptions precisely as they appear on the vessels—the copying scaled and contoured to fit the shape of the original piece. Yanlan copied eighteen inscriptions originally cast or carved on famous ancient bronze pieces. The selection of pieces ranges from vessels and weights to mirrors and bells, dating from the Zhou (approx. 1050–256 BCE ) to the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE). Below each inscription, Yanlan added his own commentary in standard script (kaishu).",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/4503/preview,"H. 10 7/8 in x W. 148 in, H. 27.6 cm x W. 375.9 cm (overall); H. 8 1/2 in x W. 43 3/4 in, H. 21.6 cm x W. 111.1 cm (image)",,,2003.42,,,,,Calligraphy after Ancient Script

Amitayus, the Buddha of Infinite Life, floats above him to grant longevity to China’s Qianlong emperor (reigned 1736-1795), who probably commissioned the painting. Below Ratnasambhava are the goddesses White Tara and Green Tara. This work, executed in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, contains a background derived from Chinese blue-and-green landscapes. The painting belongs to a large set of thangkas commissioned for the Xumifushou Monastery, which was built near the Summer Palace of Jehol (north of Beijing) by Emperor Qianlong for the sixth Panchen Lama’s visit to celebrate the emperor’s seventieth birthday in 1780.

These comments provide fascinating insights into appreciation of the artist, the work, and the theme by members of the educated elite of various times. • The theme of the painting has moral overtones, something found in many works in the collection. • The artist, Wen Jia, was a member of the educated elite of his time, so his works were appropriate for twentieth-century collectors of similar status. CONTENT This painting features the historical figure Yuan An, who lived during the late Han dynasty (206 BCE– 220 CE), around the first century of the Common Era. In the episode shown in this painting, Yuan An is trapped in a remote inn during a terrible snowstorm. When found by the regional governor and asked why he did not seek help, he replies it is because he did not want to burden anyone else, since all must have been starving during such a natural disaster.

These fans, when folded up, could be carried in the long, loose sleeves of gowns worn by both men and women, and casually displayed at a desired moment. Due to this casual use, such fans were prone to damage and loss; yet many have survived, suggesting the tremendous numbers that must have been created. Works by the professional artist Qiu Ying were among the most sought-after decorative paintings of the time, and the ownership of a fan by him was a symbol of wealth and sophistication. In response to this heavy demand, Qiu's workshop produced fans in tremendous numbers. Works in the same style, often with a forged Qiu Ying signature or seal, have continued to be produced to this day. Befitting their purpose, ""Qiu Ying"" fans are brightly colored and often painted on gold-covered paper.

Section 1: 迦陵先生填詞圖(隸書)。後學翁方綱題籤

Section 2: 十年燕市和高筑，莫鑄黃金屋。入雒暫歸來，髯逸超群談絲 
            竹。 陽羨書生眼底事，游戲人間世郎戟。莫嫌遲，酒綠燈青，袖 
            有相思字。調醉花陰。
          
Section 3: 肖像旁求，是誰省君王氣力，看豪邁青蓮待詔，紅蘭生色。花 
            底髯掀，苏子賦朝回，醉脫陶公幘。恰雙城斂翠要人描，倩彩 
            筆。    荷裳亞，蕉茵直，鵾絃倦，玉簫寂。正指點紅X，譜翻  
            昔X。鞭犢X懷陽羨雨X，記且付瀛洲石，待填成學海濟蒼     
            生，歸湖得。調滿江紅為其年道兄題《填詞圖》并正。 
        
Section 4: 側帽輕衫古意多，烏絲欄寫懊儂歌，紅兒觧唱定風波。   翠管吟
            成傾一斗，玉簫吹徹斂双蛾，酒闌曲罷奈髯何。浣溪沙。
           
Section5: 生綃何太膩，滑刺煞紫毫端。便寫來落落蕭疏神韻，懶嫚衣
            冠。長髯飄動數尺，是風塵之外一仙官。却恨幗邊行，畫底添 
            修竹千竿。     多年不訪太湖山，望斷五雲灣。想填詞末闋，看
            花眼皺，嚥酒膓寬。含商嚼徵入妙，問此中還有幾聲酸心？惜 
            美人持拍，莫教繊指多寒。 右調木蘭花慢。

Section 6: 一曲烏絲絕代工，碧簫聲裡見驚鴻。么小撥，玉玲瓏。  幾度    
      牽縈蘅薄夢，怎生消受桂堂東，教人妬煞畫圖中。

Section 7: 沒處相逢，誰知卻在丹青裡，含亳毫拂紙看着渾無字。荷雨初
      涼，湛湛吳江水。闌干倚轉添愁意，漸少來鴻矣。調寄點絳唇。
   
Section 8: 玉貌亭亭，當年待詔趨金馬。凌雲聲價，顧曲周郎亞。   若箇
      詞人得似先生？烏絲寫粉沾紅，藉千載看圖畫。
            
Section 9: 衣香鬢影共氤氳，吹徹参差入夜分；贏得迦陵新句好，不辭心
      力事朝雲。  玉梅花下交三九(髯烏絲詞中句也)，紅杏尚書枉
      擅名；記得微吟依東閣，梅花如雪撲簾旌。題髯公填詞圖二絕句。

Section 10:  翠滴銅官眉樣樹，樹裡南樓、恰是君家墅。一紙紫泥徵召去，
      紅羅三尺書官署。    玉瑩珠璫花樣女，女伴吹簫、偷譜烏絲 
      句。繡帶風前飄暮雨，幾曾繫得君家住。
      填秦少章足司馬才仲黃金縷一曲，題其年太史填詞圖。

Section 11: 荊溪髯客，早駕柳軼秦，英游罕匹。絲繡平原，寶裝內史，廿  
      載名傾南國。何處丹青粉本，寫出石闌鏤筆。高吟就，有金
      蟲，綴鬢翠眉依笛。  懸憶，應不讓，蘭畹花間，聲出鏘金
      石。紅藉蕉茵，錦排雁柱，醉傍佳人瑤瑟。少壯平生三好，潦
      倒詞塲七尺。休嗟晚，看瀛洲亭畔，重圖顏色。
      詞寄喜遷鶯，題其年老年翁詞伯《填詞圖》，並求教定。河北    
      梁清標。

Section 12: 吹簫待鳳，畫壁留人，憶舊來佳話。元和才子愛倚聲長，只修   
      珊瑚架。翠鈿量得珍珠買，便教入畫。展花間小袂，沈唫不願
      人間聽者。    平添一瓣都梁，看鴉紙斜鋪，鼠須欲下。纔回 
            首，說與春X，誤了宮商再寫。拼作湘筠，親領取、絳唇吹
            麝。怪今年栁七，匆匆奉旨填詞去也。
            
Section 13: 唫髭笑X按宮商，一幅紅箋寫斷腸，自有青娥傳點拍，X將
            惆悵賦雲郎。     譜就新聲，付玉兒紅牙低按。X参差，髯翁
      去後風流盡，誰唱迦陵絕妙詞？(X)
     
Section 14: 薛孃川紙湘娥管，珍惜裹輕裾，來催好句，詩餘就也恰對人
      餘。  畫裡真真喚來曾應，爭奈長塗，愁明夢暗，手書寄也
      難寄心書。
      
Section 15: 辛蘇豪邁，周柳纏綿，堪與君同話。丹黃隱隱儘等身定，收満
      藏書架。美髯如戟，更頰上三毫入畫。好持將束笥，流傳珍重
      長安和者。  文人似爾無雙，想萬卷都閒，十行並下。逢清
      暇，偶撿烏絲，幾闕新詞自寫。端硯花痕，看翠管藏，餘龍
      扇，教重添秀臉，長鬟彷彿聲聲唱也。
     
Section 16: 填詞老手，筆非秋垂露，髯也風流玉田侶。把琉璃、硯匣付與
      桃根。携教坐，長在國山青處。  烏絲欄乍展，曲按金荃，寫 
      出花間斷魂句。蕉葉當輕茵，聽譜参差纖指下，纏綿如訴，若
      引得天邊鳳飛來，定猜作前身是秦家女。
     
Section 17: 秋水伊人遠，喜今日畫中相見。倚遍書床，更菡蓞裁衣，芭蕉  
      作簟。醉後清平歌幾調，看出篋波紋小硯，正當前幼婦盈盈，
      待題黃絹。    山川愛陽羨，有張公玉女，生來作伴。笑髯波
      得句，朝雲按板，料理藥爐茶竈在。又重憶舞衫歌扇，恰瓊樓
      高處，相要君恩早眷。
      查鈜

Section 18: 大鼻長髯陳仲擧，便便腹裡懷今古，製得新詞低按譜，黄金   
      縷，娉娉慣解烏絲句(陳無己待兒名娉娉)。  银漢清涼纔過   
      雨，紵衫蕉簟渾無暑，何事宮商頻錯誤？邀郎顧，郎今要入
            金門去。
            
Section 19: 畫工着眼，頰上三毫神更遠；髯美頤豐，我道前身是此公。
             科头徙倚，滿腹牢愁，還得似下筆沉吟，填就新詞問那人？
       佳人難得，百琲明珠何足惜？聞道新年，己有朝雲着意憐。
       新詞按也，譜入秦簫誰聽者？不道而今，卻與狂生看箇真。
    
Section 20: 荷衣露項，看綠雲滿地，陽和時節。翠帶斜吹，檀板低敲，霓
             裳試接按三叠，殷紅冉冉春如許，漫擱筆、沉吟欲絕。待興
             來、不律飛揚，寫出慧心蓮舌。    况有娉婷侍女，似雪兒體
             態，金縷歌闋。XX焚香，一卷琅函，儘是髯公生活。長安鳳
       尾傳青瑣，禁不住曉風殘月。拼今番、桃葉渡邊，付與玉簫吹
       徹。
      
Section 21: 想韓能寫骨，張解點晴，誰歟便提髯，寫頭上賢冠、腰間羽  
       箭？何處容君瀟灑？郊只騎驢，鯤宜置壑，貌來差可怪。何年  
       身傍鈞天，勅與吹瓊粲者。   別有閒情相惹，記崔X當日捧   
       書，遺下X 村巷，朱陳圍住等閒婚嫁，枕畔甄來，裘邊桌擁，
       描繪花前月下，煞霓裳一曲，廣寒未許吟，殘醉也。
      
Section 22: 徵車似水，子虛初薦，刺史填詞，早遣宮娥傳遍？猛驚醒，殘    
       月曉風，重回首，酒旗歌扇？休怨棄，青衫已老，紫羅今換。
       調寄月華清。

Section 23: 十年苦憶元龍顏面，夢寐恐難親，不虞相見，長安道上，並見
       在傍人。停毫一顧踟躕處，欲待按歌勻，碧鴨消時，紅蕉坐
       X，何處不傳神？ 調少年遊。

Section 24: 試問年來，長是則燭高歌，敲壺成節。掀髯脫帽，題遍酒家牆
       壁？相逢漫道曲中情事，徐付琵琶，念奴翻得，忽復含毫未
       下，幾度沉吟，暗裡誰解消息？    此際鳳臺宣召，燦爛特地
       撤。侍輦陪遊處，有玉環微笑，領取歌闋，文譏錯法，綴上蕊
       珠宮闕。休憶江南，楊柳岸，唱曉風殘月。洞簫人和，是霓裳
       舊拍。
   
昔讀迦陵《烏絲集》，元龍豪氣蘇辛筆；今展《迦陵填詞圖》，清氣拂拂生髯鬚。吹花嚼蕊唫還止，春風對影鬟雲膩。譜就還教翠黛窺，歌成合付紅簫倚。陽羨書生夙擅奇，覆巢身世黨人碑。旗亭遍頌香山句，井水能歌栁七詞。小長蘆擅花間體，風流競樹騷壇幟。誰寫朱陳嫁娶圖，五雲深處徵車至。明年走馬上京華，折得東風上苑花。紅杏金蓮誇絕艷，長楊賦罷貢天家。舊時水繪園前路，玉梅花底春無數。新詞拍遍紫雲廻，琉璃捧硯人何處？壇坫東南幾巨公，文章一代真豪雄。如何鐵板铜琶句，却付女郎歌曉風。題詩諸老風情妒，幼婦辭成筆花舞。二百年來翰墨新，傾城名士俱千古。畫圖省識此花身，天女維摩想像頻。善權應有吟魂唱，山鳥山花認故人。",Painting,"Signature: beginning low right ""modeled by Ya Yanlan, a junior student from Lingnan.""

Hua is best known for his loose and spontaneous brushwork and bold composition. But as this painting demonstrates, Hua is also capable of creating highly detailed landscapes in styles practiced by the literati painters. This painting is closely related in style to the works of orthodox painters who served at the court. In addition to landscapes, Hua is also known for painting birds, animals, and plants.

This painting, which at first glance appears to be a simple still life of tulips, is in fact a expression regarding major changes in China's artistic environment. How do we know this? Tulips are not native to China, which means the artist intentionally chose a foreign topic. This would have taken some courage in 1978, just two years after the end of the Cultural Revolution. This is one of a series of tulip paintings Xiao Shufang did to celebrate China's new openness to the West. Xiao Shufang was born in Zhongshan, Guangdong province, in southern China, and studied painting at the Beijing Art School and Nanjing Central University with such leading artists as Xu Beihong (1895-1953). Between 1937 and 1940 Xiao lived in England, where she studied watercolor and sculptureùand quite likely saw tulips. She returned to China and, as with many foreign-trained artists of her generation, faced many challenges, particularly during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).

Here, a seated panda concentrates on eating the bamboo, using its paws, while three bamboo stalks and a root are close by behind him. Wu applied thick ink in broad washes to form the panda’s eyes, ears, and round structure, and lightly curving lines to sketch the contours of its body, using these contrasting tones to express the adorable playfulness of the living creature. A native of Suzhou, Wu studied art in Europe and later taught at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. The panda is one of Wu’s favorite subjects, and his characteristically rhythmic and softly accented ink washes owe much to Qi Baishi (1863–1957), who achieved considerable success as a painter of small animals. Wu’s subjects—pandas, buffalo, farmers, and children—embody the nature-loving spirit of many people in rural China. His sympathetic portrayal of lovely animals especially earned him huge popularity worldwide.

Ying Yeping in the spring of 1980.""",Painting,,,,"Inscribed by the artist: Waterfall splashes down from high cliffs. Ying Yeping in the spring of 1980. This painting of water falling from a high cliff effectively captures the sight and sounds of rapidly moving currents as they crash through the rocks, creating a cloud of mist. The rugged surfaces of the rocks, with their angular outlines, are depicted with dry, rough strokes. The application of ink washes in layers gives them a sense of solidity and volume. A native of Zhejiang province in eastern China, Ying Yeping became known at age sixteen as a painter of traditional landscapes in the Ming dynasty (1368û1644) style. Early in his career Ying came into contact with art schools and publishers in Shanghai, and his technique soon evolved to fit with the more adventurous styles practiced there. He was also exposed to Westernstyle paintings in Shanghai, and incorporated influences from them in his later works.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/72993/preview,Image: H. 17 7/8 in × W. 27 1/8 in (H. 45.4 cm × W. 68.9 cm) Overall: H. 78 1/4 in × W. 31 3/8 in (H. 198.8 cm × W. 79.7 cm),,,1994.113,,,,,Lofty Torrents

Of particular note are certain ceramic wares used specifically for sculpture: Dehua, Zhangzhou, Shiwan, and Yixing wares, all named for and characteristic of the places in which they were made. Dehua wares, known in the West since the 1700s as blanc de Chine (“China white”), were produced in Dehua, in southeastern China’s Fujian province. Technical improvements achieved in the 1500s for obtaining and purifying the milk-white glaze and ivory-white clay made possible the sculpting of large figures in porcelain. Zhangzhou wares—those attributed to the Zhangzhou kiln, also in Fujian province—are distinctive for their crackled ivory-colored glaze. The Shiwan kilns at Foshan, Guangdong province in southern China produced wares with thick bodies and colorful glazes, especially known in the West as flambé (suffused) glazes. Sculptural figures and architectural ceramics are particularly significant in Shiwan ware. Clay found at Yixing, Jiangsu province in southeastern China was used to create ceramics in a characteristic range of dark colors—from brown, purple, and green to buff and beige. Yixing ceramics are known to enhance the color, fragrance, and taste of tea; therefore, the majority of Yixing ware is in the form of tea sets.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/58603/preview,"H. 5 1/4 in x W. 2 1/2 in x D. 6 1/2 in, H. 13.33 cm x W. 6.35 cm x D. 16.50 cm",,,2000.1.a-.b,"Yixing, Jiangsu province, China",,,,Teapot in the shape of a tea crate and stool

Inscription 1：羅姬倩紅十七歲小影

此恨何時已(用飲水詞句)，鎮傷心、一回展卷，一番愍涕。秀靨小眉渾似昔，萬喚千呼難起，生悔煞、留仙無計，三載情緣別一霎，甚人天、直恁迢迢地。清淚滴，如鉛水。    銘幽欲寫相思字，奈年來、江郎才盡，筆花枯死，惆悵綺羅脂粉福，做盡愁邊滋味，看華鬢、已星星矣。縱有玉蕭能續夢，再生緣、怕阻他生裡。含酸語，卿如來。  調寄金縷曲。
甲戌初秋，夜坐花月擅扳室，展閱此卷，黯然神傷，時距倩娟之亡已三載餘矣。珊瑚身碎，然無續命之緣；環佩魂歸，帳乏潜英之製。睹驚鴻之宛在，莫喚真真，痛恨(鵲)之難(填)徒呼負負，再題此闋，用寫哀忍。倩姬有靈，亦當九原墮淚也。時蟲聲四壁，花影迷離，(X)月窺室，照人孤寂，書畢就枕，永夕不成寐。秋夢主人南雪生又題。

Inscription 2: 倩姬哀詞(臺誠跋)
姬姓羅氏，字倩紅，嶺南西樵人也。玉潤凝脂，珠光流慧，年十四即歸余。楚楚依人，娟娟此貌，花晨月夜，形影相隨。鏡檻書城，巾釵漸並，逾時四載，別夢千秋，五月榴紅，一枝花葬。年甫十七，以暴疾亡。傷哉！撫青衫之濕徧，莫罄愁懷；撿翠袖之留芬，尚餘唾(涎)香。返魂而乏術，草懷夢以無靈，和淚調鉛，含酸抱筆，詞成四闋，淚綆千絲。
四年同作傷心侶，今生總成孤負。斷淚千絲，柔腸寸折，試問泉臺知否？蘭缸坐守，記鏡約釵盟，昨宵還又，那識明朝、雨愁風惨此時候。  年來我耽愁病，鬢絲禪榻畔、文園消瘦。燕寢凝香，鴛衾偎玉，艷福幾曾消受？情緣未久，盼好月長圓，好花長壽，怎奈罡風碎紅千萬縷。
女床舊是雙棲地，重來頓增淒楚。衣冷香篝，塵X粉篋，畢竟芳魂何處？情絲萬縷，縱花月嬋娟，祗添愁緒。甘作孤鸞玉鉤，羅薦冷無主。
頻年應官聽鼓，惜香衾孤負，幾番廷佇。此日孤眠，長宵驚起，不到便鴉催曙。良辰更苦，怪艾酒蒲觴，送卿歸去，一曲惱儂、斷紅啼杜宇。(姬亡於五月九日)
傷離惜別尋常事，年年慣禁長怨。珊淚凋紅，瓊姿隕碧，爭似此時悽惋。凴棺暗喚，問何事人天、總成淒眷？料得香魂彩鸞，先返鶴書苑。  俸錢替營齊奠，使慈雲甘露，法輪應轉。伴影留春，懷仙吊夢，祗有維摩經奏，情長夢短。除再世重逢，訴伊腸斷。欲抱温香，仙裙天邊遠。
明知電火光陰幻，此生那禁憔悴，酸透梅根，苦深蓮的，迸作心頭滋味。癡情(恁)己盼，月夜歸魂，珮環聲細，立盡花陰，一庭風露曲欄底。    朝來頓添鬢雪，歎尋常眠食，與誰相倚？影怯空房，寒侵孤館，那有重逢情事？餘香竟短，唾點華凝，襲人衣袂。欲寫相思，斷腸何處寄。
同治辛末七夕，自摹倩姬小影，装成橫卷，即書哀詞於後。南雪生識於秋夢龕。

Inscription 3: 彩雲一展，認香車初到，連夕燈花艷。雙笑記那回相見，(X)(X)(guo jian)垂髫明鏡裡，又換飛瓊風調。    更闌携素手，楚楚腰支，燕燕分明掌中小。芳姓劇憐卿俏，綰蘭襟、指叠雪，香痕輕妙。算明夜，蟾光正團圓，數碧玉年華，箇儂相肖。
春寒小院，啟文窗六扇，掩映簾間玉人面，指裙腰草色綠與衫同，渾不及鏡裡眉山葱蒨。     惹儂添悶損，訴說飄零出水青蓮，綠波泣身世可憐，儂一縷情絲，穿不起淚珠成串。從今後纏綿，愛緣深，儘被底燈前，慰伊腸斷。
牙籤錦軸，傍盤龍粧鏡，圍住春風鬢雲影，更琉璃硯匣，暝寫晨書，恰伴我映月囊螢相稱。    夜闌同剪燭，擁髻微唫問字，廻身眤郎，並翠袖薄寒生。蓮漏聲沉，渾不覺鸞篝秋冷，便同夢，籠鴛被，池香也，艷福無多，那堪重省。
瑤簪墮折，痛曇花一現。珊枕 愁紅碎千片。悵返魂香沓，續命絲難，空盼着姍影素鸞天遠。      情緣同夢幻，三載年華，彈指匆匆去如箭。約略數前歡，攏袖重香，猶記取粧臺花滿。又誰料天風環珮音，早做就燈前玉弦哀怨。
淒然影室，痛真真難喚，繐帳扶床繞千遍，也明知仙夢，撒手離塵，怎禁得洗面啼痕如綫。   含悲搜盡篋，翠履銀璫，半雜香奩半書卷。觸手两餘芬，牋楮叢殘，認粉印脂痕都滿。更遺墨傷心忍重看？有小字蠶眠認她嬌腕。
飛鸞鏡冷，記私携翠袖，驀地粧臺已分手。想重泉今夜，落月彎環，應似我淒寂黄昏時候。  玳梁棲宿燕，第一難忘，仙枕餘芬襲金縷。鴛瓦玉霜寒，茗火煎愁，總難熨幾重眉皺。除夢裡相逢說相思，奈夢醒依然蘭釭孤守。
離情莫訴，悵奈何天遠，花外沈吟萬千轉。認水精簾底，朱鳥寫成纔幾日，化作翠凋紅怨。     盟言釵合，負悔煞當時，天女維摩镇相伴。仙影忒怱忽飛燕，裙裾留不住彩霞天半。早知是光陰更無多，便厮守粧臺也都情願。
銜珠腕約，痛臂盟重認，私叩綢繆竟無準，把擅權心事，細祝靈香應。鑒取珊挽淚痕紅暈。    柔鄉空占，總冉冉嬌雲仙袂，凌虛散花隕。艷福等閒看，熨體偎衾，都認作尋常緣分。奈今日思量，總淒然嘆薄命，難消儘，添長恨。
遺芬在抱，賸秋雲羅帕，紫玉烟痕已驚化。對荒寮秋雨，愁奠椒漿酸風裡，空見紙錢飛乍。  玉棺誰伴取，佛院悲凉，可有慈雲露珠灑？烟冷玉鱼寒，猶幸靈簫有仙侶，彩鸞同跨，比長草空林夜悠悠，算輸爾良宵夜臺清話。(姬柩XX觀音院，其鄰室左右六七棺皆新亡少姝也。)
文園瘦損，悵帶圍寬盡，愁寫脩眉遠山暈。折俸錢十萬，營奠營齊，聊慰汝三載添香情分。韋郎今已老，頓減風情，未卜他生杳難問。縱有玉簫緣，鸞鏡重窺，怕驚見潘郎絲鬢。止一卷金經法王前，好懺悔中年萬千愁恨。",Painting,"Seal: “葉衍蘭印”白文方印；“南雪”朱文方印；“韻琴讀畫之所”白文長方印引首。

According to his biography Yanlan had six concubines in addition to his first wife, and Lady Luo (1853/54–1871) was Ye Yanlan's companion for only four years. Yanlan painted this portrait in 1871 after the passing of Lady Luo a couple of months prior during Qixi (the 7th day of the 7th lunar month). The colophons were subsequently added afterwards including one in Autumn 1874 . The young woman is seated reading a book near a Ming-style scholar's table with books and writing utensils. The smooth line work and the subtle coloring of her clothes seem to characterize her as a sweet young woman of learning and refined taste. Ye Yanlan added three colophons to this poignant portrait, written successively on the first three anniversaries of Lady Luo's death. These writings are filled with sadness and loneliness, with Yanlan recounting her brief life and lamenting her death.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/58438/preview,"H. 10 15/16 in x W. 123 11/16, H. 27.8 cm x W.  314.2 cm (Overall); H. 10 15/16 in x W. 39 3/4, 27.8 cm x 101 cm (calligraphy); H. 10 15/16 in x W. 50 3/16, 27.8 cm x 127.5 cm (painting and colophon)",,,2003.37,,,,,Small Portrait of Seventeen-Year-Old Lady Luo Jinghong

He often imitated the figure style of Tang Bohu, a famous Ming artist living in Suzhou, and probably created this lovely scene for the market. This painting was on display last year, and the audience liked Du’s artistic rendering of the children that kept the lively atmosphere of a leisure moment in the summertime. It is important to add this example to showcase the artistic taste and painting market of Canton in the early modern era (from the late Qing to the Republic of China period). This charming depiction of a popular game is full of movement, color, and playful details. The game is played by two competing teams, each consisting of a boy and his cricket. The person whose cricket subdues his rival is the winner, having demonstrated stronger strategic skills. In this picture, two boys squatting in a plantain-and-rock garden concentrate on a clay basin, a common container for insects. One boy pokes inside the bowl with a freshly broken branch, while the other takes up the challenge by dropping a wide brush toward the battleground. Walking toward them is another competitor holding a tray with a covered basin, as if preventing his cricket from jumping out of the ring before the fight. The boys’ bald heads with top knots, loosely embroidered jackets, and red shoes are all examples of Ming-dynasty fashion. The painting’s lifelike vitality and charming subjects pull viewers into the scene. For this work, the Guangdong-based Du Heng adopted, as an early model, the work of the figure painter Tang Yin (1470–1523).",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/61352/preview,"H. 47 1/2 in x W. 13 3/4 in, H. 120.7 cm x W. 34.9 cm (image); H. 88 1/4 in x W. 20 5/8 in, H. 224.2 cm x W. 52.4 cm (overall)",,,2021.116,,,,,Boys Playing with Crickets

The details of the artist’s biography are sketchy, but we know that Hu Zhang was a close friend of Xugu, a leader of the Shanghai school artists of the time. For much of his career, Hu lived in Suzhou and visited Shanghai frequently, and his painting style and expressive brushwork reflect the influence of other peer artists in this flourishing port city. Hu traveled to Japan in 1879 and many of his surviving works were painted during his sojourn there. In 1896, the same year as Xugu’s death, Hu Zhang returned to Japan for the second and final time.

The overall contour is a gently sloping arc. The decor of the bottom half consists of three deep grooves that rise up and culminate in staggered wave crests with incised lines highlighting the spiral ends. The handle is decorated primarily with a sinuous dragon rising up out of the waves, surrounded by clouds. The scales and claws of the dragon are finely detailed. The upper jaw is elongated and extends backwards and inwards; it continues the elegant contour. A raised relief tail extends downwards and meets the crest of the waves below. Wings or fins rise from the midsection of the body. The clouds are a combination of incisions and deep grooves, thus creating rounded forms. The sum is a sculptural, sumptuous feel. There is an inherent rhythm that is created by the writhing dragon, swirling clouds, and breaking waves. Pendants strung as necklaces or pectoral ornaments were often worn in life and then buried in death. They had their prototype in the Neolithic period but became far more complex in the Eastern Zhou and Han dynasty. There was a great variety of pendant shapes and arrangements that were used to reflect the wearer's sex and status. This piece was most likely a bottom piece in an arrangement. There are many places to attach the above pendant or pendants to this piece through the dragon and cloud interlace, but there is no perforation or other means to fasten more pieces to the bottom, pointed end. Peter Lam notes that ""similar arched pendants are not uncommon in burials of the Warring States to Han periods...[and that] most of them are finely carved"" (Lam 273). See pectoral of a ""Concubine"" (set E) from the tomb of the Nanyue King (Lam, plate 149) for a possible arrangement. The stone of this piece is totally altered, either by burial or by other means. It is a uniform bone white and completely opaque. There are small areas of brown surface stains. Despite the alteration of the stone, the polish is quite high; the overall level of finish is very fine. 1. Rawson p. 287, fig 3 2. Chou, p. 273, fig 9-24 3.

A spectacular openwork mouth reveals a solid tongue curling up in the center. The prominent eyes, eyebrows, and horns are finished in round relief, in contrast to the refined long-line incised work used for the hair. The Chinese term for jadeite, feicui, was originally the name of a bird from southwestern Asia mentioned in books of the Han period. The word was said to come from the names of two other birds—the fei with red feathers and the cui with green. Tang period documents note that it was a bird with both red and green feathers. Later authors borrowed the term to allude to beautiful colors on ornaments and jewelry. Around 1900, some scholars claimed that objects found in Zhou and Han sites were made of jadeite. Others said that China had not imported jadeite from Burma until the eighteenth century. Still others argued that Yun'nan and Henan provinces were sources of jadeite in China. A recent systematic study of gemstones by geologist Luan Bing'ao (1989, 97–106) concluded that jadeite was not native to China and entered China from Burma through Yun'nan during the Qing period. He noted that the jewelry market was filled with manufactured ""jadeite"" and true jadeite with artificial colors.

Conversely, the decorative motifs of the body are all derived from Middle Shang prototypes.

The earliest Chinese metal vessels were created by hammering bronze into the desired shapes. The bodies of these vessels tend to be thin and their profiles exaggerated versions of earlier ceramic vessels. Later, artisans developed the technology to cast vessels by pouring the molten metal into molds. The earliest bronze vessels probably borrowed their shapes from ceramic prototypes of the late Neolithic period. Due to the nature of the material, most ceramic forms had thick bodies, rounded profiles, and few, if any, surface protrusions. This influence can be seen in the legs and overall profile of the bronze. Changes in bronze vessel forms from these rather awkward beginnings indicate their creators’ growing familiarity with the unique characteristics of the clay-mold casting process. While surface decoration became quite complex, most bronze forms remained relatively simple—either curved or square—to facilitate the release of the mold pieces. Three-dimensional additions, such as elaborate handles or functional parts of vessels, were often precast and attached to the body by one of two complicated processes.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/12289/preview,"H. 11 1/4 in x W. 6 1/4 in x D. 6 1/4 in, H. 28.6 cm x W. 15.9 cm x D. 15.9 cm",,,B60B777,"Anyang, China",,,,Ritual wine vessel (gu)

Bodhi leaves are heart shaped with a characteristically long drip tip, a natural drying device that allows raindrops to roll off easily during a tropical downpour. In India and China these leaves are soaked in water for as long as a month, until the green cells have disintegrated and only the vascular system remains.

Because of the way in which they were displayed, such scrolls were often damaged and relatively smaller numbers have survived. There are numerous areas of damage on this scroll.

She is often portrayed as a young woman with claw-like fingernails, wearing an apron or shawl of leaves, and carrying either a basket of fungus or peaches, or a container of fungus wine, all foods believed to promote long life. In addition, her association with the hemp plant ma (Cannabis sativa) further enhances her ties to immortality: every part of the hemp plant has been used in medicine since ancient times, especially its seeds which were believed to firm the flesh and prevent old age. According to her biography in an early text, Magu lived during the reign of Emperor Huan (reign 147–167) of the Han dynasty, and she was the younger sister of a Taoist adept named Wang Fangping. She appeared as a young girl of eighteen years. Her hair was tied into a topknot, and she had hands that looked like the claws of a bird. Magu herself had already become an immortal, having thrice seen the Eastern Ocean change into mulberry fields, an indication of her transcendence of time. While Shoulao is commonly worshipped as the God of Longevity, Chinese women are more attached to Magu. Therefore, these paintings are often hung in banquet halls during celebrations of women's birthdays. Magu brewed wine from the lingzhi fungus of immortality. She is depicted here with a container of the wine, a birthday gift for the Queen Mother of the West. This motif of ""Magu offering longevity"" (Magu xianshou) is a popular theme for depictions of the goddess.

The topknot, instead of being a plain conical shape, is more like a chignon combed nicely in the back. This is not a hairstyle associated with the Buddha, but is more akin to the hair of Guanyin, the Buddhist Lord of Mercy. The statue is based on gilt bronze prototypes from the 1700s. The snail curls, the nicely pleated shawl over his left shoulder, and the robe fanning out gracefully between his legs are all characteristic of such statues. The insides of gilt bronze pieces are hollow and are filled with objects during consecration; afterward, they are sealed with a metal plate incised with the crossed thunderbolts. This jade example is solid, but a motif of the crossed thunderbolts incised on the bottom imitates the style of the gilt bronze statues.

Of particular note are certain ceramic wares used specifically for sculpture: Dehua, Zhangzhou, Shiwan, and Yixing wares, all named for and characteristic of the places in which they were made. Dehua wares, known in the West since the 1700s as blanc de Chine (“China white”), were produced in Dehua, in southeastern China’s Fujian province. Technical improvements achieved in the 1500s for obtaining and purifying the milk-white glaze and ivory-white clay made possible the sculpting of large figures in porcelain. Zhangzhou wares—those attributed to the Zhangzhou kiln, also in Fujian province—are distinctive for their crackled ivory-colored glaze. The Shiwan kilns at Foshan, Guangdong province in southern China produced wares with thick bodies and colorful glazes, especially known in the West as flambé (suffused) glazes. Sculptural figures and architectural ceramics are particularly significant in Shiwan ware. Clay found at Yixing, Jiangsu province in southeastern China was used to create ceramics in a characteristic range of dark colors—from brown, purple, and green to buff and beige.

The ideal scholar is always depicted as forthright, dedicated to knowledge, and the pursuit of scholarship. One example is Zhu Yin, who was so poor that he could not afford to buy candles for his nightly studies. He made a night-light by gathering glowworms and placing them in a bag that he hung on a post. Another story describes the young man Sun Kang, who was also too poor to afford candles to use in the evenings.

Several color combinations—with pigments applied either in underglaze or in colorful overglaze enamels—flourished through the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Multicolor, or “five colors” (wucai), decoration is a term applied to the combination of blue underglaze with three or more overglaze colors. The colors are applied in equal proportions; thus, no single color dominates and a balanced decoration is achieved. During the Ming dynasty, artists developed an unprecedented decorative scheme in which two or more colors were used in combination; this is sometimes called “three colors” (sancai) decoration. Pieces using this technique were produced during the reign of the Kangxi emperor (1662–1722) and are distinctive for their absence of red and their predominance of cooler colors: lavender, light yellow, and/or light green. One hallmark of Ming ceramics is the development of a stable, subtle marigold yellow.

The jade, from a mine in Manasi in Xinjiang, has been given a polished, soapy luster, and the subject is similar to one on an ancient bronze. The tall vessel, mounted over a saddlelike cloth on the deer's back, is a bronze zun form, with a flaring top and a bulging waist. A series of friezes commonly seen on bronzes decorate it: panels on top shaped like banana leaves, four animal masks on the waist, and cloud patterns on the lower portion. The saddle cloth is edged in cloud heads and filled with stylized snow patterns, each consisting of six diamond-shaped panels that are repeated on the deer's body as smaller single-lined designs. At the bottom, the cloven hooves are shown by incised crevices, and small depressions are carved in the hind hooves. The piece is held in balance by the deer's horns, which curve back from its head to connect with the vessel. By the 1700s, this subject had been identified as a symbol of longevity on bronzes, a symbol that began to be used in the Tang period) (Liang Shizheng [1700–1800] 1965, vol. 2, chap. 11, pp. 33–36). Two plaques found in a Song site in Xi'an and a Jin tomb in Heilongjiang were decorated with deer in an openwork grove (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plates 128, 160). Several extant jades in the Palace Museum, Beijing, attributed to the Song to Jin periods, have similar images of individual deeror deer in forests (Palace Museum, Beijing 1995, vol. 41, plates 50–52). None of these deerhas a vessel on its back, however; that idea'was a later elaboration of the legend.

Flying sparks of (water) beads would fall to stun the sages, but the waterfall seems to be suspended in the sky. Even a gentleman of honor can be despised by a lady; one's failure would be remembered long. Does good news in spring signal a success? (No), an arrow cannot remain on a bow forever. By His Majesty in the spring of renwu"" (1762). The poem ends with two seal marks. Another white jade ring bears four characters in the main field, reading Qianlong nianzhi (produced during the Qianlong period), arranged alternately in a circle and a square, each flanked by symmetrical tendrils (National Palace Museum 1976, vol. 3, chap. 17, p. 5). The upper border is encircled with a band of C scrolls arranged into triangle forms. The third white ring has a border design of birds and beasts standing among clouds, encircling the upper and lower rims. The main field bears four characters flanked by stylized dragons, reading Qianlong yuzhi (produced for the use of his majesty Qianlong). One green ring is rendered with four-character medallions, each framed with bosses (ornamental raised areas), and alternating with floral scrolls. On another green ring, two squares display symbols on opposite sides on a background of a C-shaped clouds, one square enclosing the character qian (sky) and the other, its diagram mark (a series of lines that symbolize sky). Four roundels containing the mark of the Qianlong reign on the last green ring alternate with four beasts amid a ground of small circular beads. A frieze of meander encircles the top and bottom rims. All six rings have been treated to produce brown patches on their surfaces. The incisions and shallow relief are worked evenly. The case—three connected cylinders—has a base consisting of three domed circles and a cover with three stud knobs that serve as legs. Two inner trays, each containing three rings, are stacked inside. The base is embellished with a pair of curled dragons in clouds, and a similar design graces two raised friezes on the outside of the case, on an incised meander background, bordered by a raised meander frieze above and below. The cover is adorned with raised banana leaves edged by a meander band. Exquisite inlays of gold and silver reveal superb eighteenth-century craft. Several sets of rings were made with such cases for the Qianlong court in different years.

Several color combinations—with pigments applied either in underglaze or in colorful overglaze enamels—flourished through the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Multicolor, or “five colors” (wucai), decoration is a term applied to the combination of blue underglaze with three or more overglaze colors. The colors are applied in equal proportions; thus, no single color dominates and a balanced decoration is achieved. During the Ming dynasty, artists developed an unprecedented decorative scheme in which two or more colors were used in combination; this is sometimes called “three colors” (sancai) decoration. Pieces using this technique were produced during the reign of the Kangxi emperor (1662–1722) and are distinctive for their absence of red and their predominance of cooler colors: lavender, light yellow, and/or light green. One hallmark of Ming ceramics is the development of a stable, subtle marigold yellow. Two popular multicolor combination for yellow wares—red over yellow, and green over yellow—were developed during this time, the former employing a red overglaze on a yellow ground, and the latter a green enamel painted directly on a yellow ground.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/17175/preview,"H. 18 5/8 in x Diam. 13 7/8 in, H. 47.3 cm x Diam. 35.2 cm",,,B60P1226,Northern China,,,,Lidded jar with a scene of celebrating longevity by Daoist Immortals

This technique, known as “mercury gilding,” involved an application of a paste-like mixture of gold and mercury on bronze to create a gilded surface, which also gave the metal greater resistance to tarnishing. The bronze was heated by charcoal fire to evaporate the mercury, leaving the gold bonded to its surface. This gold surface layer was then burnished with a hard, smooth metal or stone tool to make it more compact and shiny. The use of gold on bronze in China dates back more than two thousand years, and this high-cost technique was traditionally used for luxurious decorations and icons. Many bronze-cast buddha and bodhisattva statues were adorned with this gilding technique to attract more devotees. Small, lustrous figures and icons like these in the cases were carried for spiritual protection on journeys and placed on household altars for worship. It is important to note that many altar shrines were made in segments and then assembled, and so over the centuries some have lost attachments or have had parts from similar-sized works reattached.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/73313/preview,"H. 13 3/8 in x W. 8 in x D. 5 in, H. 34 cm x W. 20.3 cm x D. 12.7 cm",,,B60S566,China,,,,Seated bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (Guanyin)

Imaginative, refreshing and technically daring as it is, this trend is the swan song of an art that had been self-sufficient for a thousand years. With few exceptions, shapes are plain, if not pedestrian. The now completely secularized metal is used as a mere background for designs that are for the most part borrowed from other media, such as painting, and are no longer adapted to the anatomy of the containers. Three or these vessels, the dui (B60B1080) and the two hu (B60B30+, B60B1079) bear designs of copper inlay. At first, as in the dui , the decor was done in incised lines filled with copper thread. Later on, as in the case of the two hu , decorative motifs were carved and then filled with copper foil cut-outs in a manner resembling niello work. The asymmetric hu (back left, B60B30+) is another of the few new shapes that saw the light during the late 6th century BCE Its decor is so close in its execution to that of the tall standard hu (B60B1079,which happens to be the biggest vessel of its kind in existence) next to it that it is not unreasonable to assume that both vessels were produced by the same workshop. From top to foot these vessels are covered with narrow circular belts containing a variety of curvilinear, almost calligraphic zoomorphic and geometric motifs. This dense population is shown in profile and according to the most demanding laws or symmetry at least where the tall hu is concerned. In addition vertical and horizontal axes are marked by geometric figures, mainly H-shaped. Some of the motifs such as the regardant dragons can be traced back to the main stream of ancestral bronze decor. Others are revolutionary. For instance, arched felines, which do not antedate the second hair of the 6th century BCE. The handles of both vessels and the spurred rings on top or the lid of the tall Hu with their full round animal masks or their incised details are concessions made to the prevalent taste of the day.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/58610/preview,H. 12 in x W. 5 3/8 in,,,B60B1079,China,Spring and Autumn period (770-476 BCE),,,Ritual wine vessel (hu)

The use of an embroidered collar piece became popular with women and children, not only for its enchanting colors and motifs but also for its small size, which made it easier to embroider. The combination of naturalistic and stylized designs is apparent in the embroidery of flowers. Symbolic of prosperity, femininity, fertility, and purity, the peony, lotus, and orchid were frequently used as signature themes, as on this collar. A pair of butterflies, flying toward the orchid along the collar’s edges, evokes lovely images of a garden.

Certain ancient types among Song official productions (960 –1279)were continuously copied. Ming official factories never stopped experimenting with varieties of new glazes, strains, and decorative devices to maintain porcelain's dominance over other ceremonial materials. A group of tablewares from the Avery Brundage collection illustrates four types of monochrome glazes produced in the Ming imperial factories in Jingdezhen from the early fifteenth through the sixteenth centuries. The Yongle emperor chose the color white and Islamic metalwork–inspired forms to be used at altars and imperial temples. The fifteenth-century white glaze, soupy and smooth, is known as ""sweet white."" The dark blue glaze, favored by earlier Mongol rulers, was successfully reproduced during the Xuande period. Blue was often used in ritual celebrations on sacrificial altars. Eloquent names, such as ""gemstone blue"" and ""celestial blue,"" were documented. Yellow, viewed as a noble color, became fashionable in the late fifteenth century. This low-fire glaze could cover a previously fired white glaze for refiring, or coat a clay body for only one firing. The yellow wares presented to the Chenghua and Zhengde courts exhibit a delicate body and refined texture with sensitive color tone, winning the admirable description ""chicken fat."" The brown glaze resulted from an experiment in the Xuande reign, when official porcelain manufacturers attempted to re-create the brown glaze of a type of ancient Ding ware that had once been presented to the Northern Song court. On Ming imperial porcelain, brown glaze that glimmered on the surface with a shiny metallic luster was called ""purple gold,"" after the description for brown Song Ding ware. Matte brown glaze was referred to as ""soybean paste.""",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/17684/preview,"H. 4 1/8 in x Diam. 7 7/8 in, H. 10.5 cm x Diam. 20 cm",,,B60P1640,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",,,,Bowl with incised lotus scrolls

These practices lost some of their importance with the breakdown of the Zhou government and ritual system. The subsequent social changes corresponded with the beginnings of the use of iron and other changes in technology, and resulted in an increase of wealth among a much broader segment of the population. These new patrons created a demand for luxury items in bronze, jade, lacquer, textile, and other materials. Items of personal adornment in bronze, which had been rare in earlier periods, were created in great numbers. Many were small in scale, elegant, and superbly crafted. Gilding, inlaying, and other decorative techniques also became more common and many items featured inlays of gold, silver, jade, and precious stones. All of these qualities are found in belt hooks, which were used to hang small objects or fasten elaborate belts around loose-fitting embroidered silk robes. From the objects in this case you will see that bronze, iron, and jade served as bases for these belt hooks. Iron corrodes much more easily than bronze, and few iron pieces have survived from this early period.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/14884/preview,"H. 3/4 in x W. 3 1/2 in x D. 1/8 in, H. 1.9 cm x W. 8.9 cm x D. .32 cm",,,B60J683,China,Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BCE),,,Dragon-shaped pendant
images/asian_chinese2371.jpg,The Avery Brundage Collection,,Nephrite,,,,Not on view,Chinese Art,,,,Jade And Stones,,,Ming dynasty (1368-1644) or earlier,"To create this hook, the artisan used pale gray-green hetian jade with whitish mottling and gray veins, polished to a waxy shine. The piece is distinguished from most other hooks by its one short end curving almost parallel to the other, which is carved to depict a dragon's head. The short end has a tenon pierced horizontally with a hole. The dragon's head has a slit mouth with a small cavity and cloudlike whirls on the beard, eyebrows, and hair. Varied short bevel strokes and densely curved lines produce details. A red residue in the mouth and holes consists of remnants of applied cinnabar. Yang Boda, research fellow at the Palace Museum, Beijing, in his survey of the jade collection of the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco in 1996, dated this piece to the Ming period. A few months later, Mou Yongkang, archaeologist of the Zhejiang Institute of Archaeology, during a short visit to the museum, concluded that the piece was an earlier work. Archaeologists have found no other hooks with quite the same pierced end and tenon, apparently designed for stringing or fastening something to the hook. Generally, men wore belt hooks, and only occasionally were hooks found in female tombs. The earliest excavated belt hooks, dating to the Spring and Autumn Period (771–476 bce), were found in the Central Plains area and were made of metal. There is archaeological evidence that the single-hook form continued until the Han period, but evidence is lacking as yet of the use of a hook and buckle together in early periods. Three possible functions have been suggested for this piece: (1) as a woman's pendant in a shape borrowed from a belt hook; (2) as an ornament modified from an old hook; and (3) as a specially designed belt hook with holes for hanging objects. Any of these would have been fairly common in jade craft. The nicely proportioned dragon's head has a strongly archaic style. The cavities reveal a rather simple crafting process, and the horizontal slit on the mouth is not perfectly straight, signaling that it was made using a manual tool.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/14947/preview,"H. 1 in x W. 1 1/2 in x D. 3/8 in, H. 2.5 cm x W. 3.8 cm x D. 0.7 cm",,,B60J715,China,,,,Hook with perforations

Many of these designs consist of composite or wholly imaginary animals. On bronze vessels of the Shang dynasty, the most frequently seen of these animals is the taotie, a composite dragon-like animal whose body has been split down the middle and splayed out on both sides of the head. The head of the taotie has large eyes, horns, and a gaping mouth; the body at times has only one pair of legs. As the gong illustrates, in later periods of the Shang dynasty the taotie was joined by a wide range of dragons, birds, and other animals, both real and imaginary. What meaning did the taotie have? Some scholars believe that it evolved from decorative patterns and had no real meanings. Others argue that a motif as prominent as the taotie must have been central to the culture’s world view.

Birds were much favored as pendants on personal ornaments during the Bronze Age and were buried with their owners for use in the afterlife. Several examples from late Shang tombs in Henan are somewhat longer rectangles. Those Shang birds are distinguished by a long, graceful diadem on the head and an energetic tail (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 2, plates 88–90).

Particular flowers or combinations of birds and flowers were often chosen less for their intrinsic beauty than for their symbolic meaning. As a result, Ming and Qing artisans became successful in blending decorative motifs from multiple sources into a consistent, cohesive visual language. This language— utilizing birds, flowers, plants, and landscapes together with color symbolism—continued to evolve and expand during the Qing dynasty, reaching a pinnacle in the 1700s. Technological developments made possible the large variety of sizes, shapes, and decorative techniques of the objects in this case.

A kui dragonet creeps on the top, its upper body in openwork and its lower limbs clinging to the plate. The back of the plate is plain, with a rectangular slot off to one side. Jade sword pommels and guards emerged in the early Eastern Zhou period, while buckles and chapes did not appear until around 400 bce. Sword buckles have been unearthed mainly in the Central Plains, Liaoning, Hunan, Yunnan, and Guangdong. After the Han period, the term wei was used for a sword buckle, also known as a slide. A buckle would be attached vertically to the upper part of a scabbard, with the buckle's slot facing the scabbard. The slot may have been intended as a fingerhold, although recently it has been suggested that a belt might have been inserted through the slot so that the sword could be carried on a person's waist. A relief or line work dragonet, which always had a long, curving tail that split into two coiled floral ends, ornamented the scabbard buckles of Western Han nobles (Museum of the Western Han Tomb of the King of Nanyue 1991, plate 72; Institute of Archaeology 1980a, vol. 2, plate 64, fig. 5).

Strongly influenced by the taste established by Neo-Confucian doctrine, the scholar-officials tended to be fascinated with the past. They were avid collectors of archaic bronzes and objects in archaic styles in a number of materials. This gray jade vessel is a fine example. While it appears to combine two Bronze Age forms, the jue and the gong, both its shape and its decoration reflect late Ming understanding of these early prototypes. Typical of Ming styles, the decor is loosely based on late Shang dynasty models and is rather roughly cut. The upper band, which continues over the spout, consists of dragons and abstracted animal patterns, while the middle band is the classic taotie mask. The legs have blade-shaped devices with heavy flanges. The top of the handle is bitten by a snarling mask, and the linked spirals that decorate the handle are more reminiscent of late Zhou than of Shang decor.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/15187/preview,"H. 3 7/8 in x W. 4 1/2 in x D. 2 3/4 in, H. 9.8 cm x W. 11.4 cm x D. 7.0 cm",,,B60J862,China,,,,Ewer on four legs

Large orchestras played a range of percussion, string, and woodwind instruments. Most were made of wood and other perishable materials and have long since vanished. However, large sets of bells have been discovered, and these provide insights into the complexity of Zhou-dynasty court music. The set unearthed from the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng has sixty-five bells, with the largest one more than five feet tall. Bronze ritual bells found in tombs were arranged in sets, called bianzhong. A complete set could include three types of bells, sorted in groups from large to small. The most common types of bells in the Eastern Zhou period (770–256 BCE) were yongzhong, which have a long columnar handle on the top, and niuzhong, which have a semicircular knob instead of a handle. Found less frequently, bozhong generally have loop handles, a flat bottom, and a rounder body. Bell sets with as many as sixty-five pieces, the largest more than five feet in height, have been discovered in Eastern Zhou-period aristocratic tombs.

They should be seen primarily as either presentation pieces or objects that served some role in court rituals or ceremonies. In order to create a piece of carved lacquer of this level of complexity, the inner wood core was usually strengthened with lacquer-impregnated cloth. Then several layers of lacquer mixed with very fine clay were applied to form a uniform surface, followed by multiple layers of lacquer. Each layer had to cure fully and then be lightly buffed before the next layer could be applied. In most cases a telltale line in a contrasting color of lacquer was applied in the first several layers. This served as a depth guide for the carver. In this example, alternate layers of black and red served this purpose. The base coat, which appears at the bottom of the most deeply carved areas, is red.

The influence of scholarly taste had its effect on virtually all aspects of artistic production, most obviously painting and calligraphy. Advances in the print industry allowed broad access to reproductions of pictorial imagery, which became pervasive in mediums such as ceramics, textiles, and lacquer. The popularity of landscape paintings and scenes from everyday life extended into all mediums. Especially popular at this time were how-to manuals that detailed the techniques of painting—methods for depicting the lines of garments and for types of dots and strokes in landscape elements. The use of such manuals by artists and artisans working in many mediums resulted in highly conventionalized brushwork and other formulaic styles.

The approach to representing flowers during the Song dynasty was one of studied elegance. Emphasis was upon naturalistic shapes and precise, realistic depiction of scenes found in nature. Bird-and-flower themes were often featured in hand-sculpted and incised decoration, with careful attention paid to subtle colors and uniformity of design. Certain birds were always paired with certain flowers as they occur in nature. Encouraged by the contemporary vogue for keeping flowers in pots, artisans also created ceramic flowerpots.

In fact, such wares have been reproduced from time to time since the tenth century. The most successful versions were made in the seventeenth century. With the advent of increased development and industrialization in China during the late nineteenth century, there were numerous road and housing projects, many of which unearthed vast numbers of ancient tombs. Among the objects in these tombs were some of these colorful ceramics, which had been made to accompany the dead in their afterlives. These objects immediately began to appear on the art market and became popular in the West. In response to this demand, another round of fakes began to be made. One of these vessels is genuine and one is an excellent modern imitation of a Tang sancai vessel. A curator examined the vessels and pointed out that, while the glazes looked good, the shape of one of the pieces was odd. A small sample was taken from each vessel and tested using the thermoluminescence (TL) technique. The result of the TL test confirmed the curator's suspicion that one of the vessels was made in the twentieth century. Can you tell which one? (Lift the flap to find out.)

Particular flowers or combinations of birds and flowers were often chosen less for their intrinsic beauty than for their symbolic meaning. As a result, Ming and Qing artisans became successful in blending decorative motifs from multiple sources into a consistent, cohesive visual language. This language— utilizing birds, flowers, plants, and landscapes together with color symbolism—continued to evolve and expand during the Qing dynasty, reaching a pinnacle in the 1700s. Technological developments made possible the large variety of sizes, shapes, and decorative techniques of the objects in this case.

Large orchestras played a range of percussion, string, and woodwind instruments. Most were made of wood and other perishable materials and have long since vanished. However, large sets of bells have been discovered, and these provide insights into the complexity of Zhou-dynasty court music. The set unearthed from the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng has sixty-five bells, with the largest one more than five feet tall. Bronze ritual bells found in tombs were arranged in sets, called bianzhong. A complete set could include three types of bells, sorted in groups from large to small. The most common types of bells in the Eastern Zhou period (770–256 BCE) were yongzhong, which have a long columnar handle on the top, and niuzhong, which have a semicircular knob instead of a handle. Found less frequently, bozhong generally have loop handles, a flat bottom, and a rounder body. Bell sets with as many as sixty-five pieces, the largest more than five feet in height, have been discovered in Eastern Zhou-period aristocratic tombs.

The defining characteristic of these vessels is that they have a mouth and a spout but no separate handle. The kendi (a Malay/Indonesian term) is a variation of the kundika; usually of rather squat proportions and made of ceramic, kendi were widely used in Southeast Asia.

Imaginative, refreshing and technically daring as it is, this trend is the swan song of an art that had been self-sufficient for a thousand years. With few exceptions, shapes are plain, if not pedestrian. The now completely secularized metal is used as a mere background for designs that are for the most part borrowed from other media, such as painting, and are no longer adapted to the anatomy of the containers. Three or these vessels, the dui (B60B1080) and the two hu (B60B30+, B60B1079) bear designs of copper inlay. At first, as in the dui , the decor was done in incised lines filled with copper thread. Later on, as in the case of the two hu , decorative motifs were carved and then filled with copper foil cut-outs in a manner resembling niello work. The dui (B60B1080) is one of the earliest specimens of a new, near-spherical shape. With its three spurred, ring-like feet, the cover can be used as a bowl in its own right and can only be told from the lower part of the vessel in that it is not equipped with handles. The center of the cupola is occupied by a geometrical design comprising a composite whorl-circle bordered by a twisted rope pattern and, on the outside, a row of eight heart-shaped lappets. The rest of the decor consists of seven identical hybrid felines, three on the cover and four on the bowl. Like all felines in this series, they assume a markedly arched position, almost like cats setting up their backs.

The influence of scholarly taste had its effect on virtually all aspects of artistic production, most obviously painting and calligraphy. Advances in the print industry allowed broad access to reproductions of pictorial imagery, which became pervasive in mediums such as ceramics, textiles, and lacquer. The popularity of landscape paintings and scenes from everyday life extended into all mediums. Especially popular at this time were how-to manuals that detailed the techniques of painting—methods for depicting the lines of garments and for types of dots and strokes in landscape elements. The use of such manuals by artists and artisans working in many mediums resulted in highly conventionalized brushwork and other formulaic styles.

Several color combinations—with pigments applied either in underglaze or in colorful overglaze enamels—flourished through the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Multicolor, or “five colors” (wucai), decoration is a term applied to the combination of blue underglaze with three or more overglaze colors. The colors are applied in equal proportions; thus, no single color dominates and a balanced decoration is achieved. During the Ming dynasty, artists developed an unprecedented decorative scheme in which two or more colors were used in combination; this is sometimes called “three colors” (sancai) decoration. Pieces using this technique were produced during the reign of the Kangxi emperor (1662–1722) and are distinctive for their absence of red and their predominance of cooler colors: lavender, light yellow, and/or light green. One hallmark of Ming ceramics is the development of a stable, subtle marigold yellow. Two popular multicolor combination for yellow wares—red over yellow, and green over yellow—were developed during this time, the former employing a red overglaze on a yellow ground, and the latter a green enamel painted directly on a yellow ground.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/17548/preview,"H. 5 1/2 in x Diam. 5 1/4 in, H. 14 cm x Diam. 13.3 cm",,,B60P1523,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",,,,Jar with design of dragons amid clouds

These practices lost some of their importance with the breakdown of the Zhou government and ritual system. The subsequent social changes corresponded with the beginnings of the use of iron and other changes in technology, and resulted in an increase of wealth among a much broader segment of the population. These new patrons created a demand for luxury items in bronze, jade, lacquer, textile, and other materials. Items of personal adornment in bronze, which had been rare in earlier periods, were created in great numbers. Many were small in scale, elegant, and superbly crafted. Gilding, inlaying, and other decorative techniques also became more common and many items featured inlays of gold, silver, jade, and precious stones. All of these qualities are found in belt hooks, which were used to hang small objects or fasten elaborate belts around loose-fitting embroidered silk robes. From the objects in this case you will see that bronze, iron, and jade served as bases for these belt hooks.

The use of green jade and the design of a rather elongated body attempted to follow a Western Zhou style. Western Zhou fish pendants were relaxed, simple, and naïve (Liu 1996, plates 12, 27, 36, 61, 72–76). They had straightforward shapes, with no exaggerated contours. Loosely arranged short strokes depicted fins, and the fish generally did not have slits or pointed notches for features. The surface of this piece was altered by chemical treatment, so that one side was deliberately left with more clear areas than the other. The irregular outer silhouette, with its intensively cut fins, was a distortion of the Western Zhou fish design.

These bones, primarily the shoulder blades of cattle and the undershells of turtles, were dried and had holes drilled in them at regular intervals. A question was directed to an ancestor by applying a hot poker to these holes to make the surface crack. A specialist, usually a king or a member of a ruling family, would then read the appearance of the cracks to obtain the ancestor’s response. Both the question—in positive and negative forms—and the results were written on the surface of the oracle bone.

Here it has been carved from an opaque, grayish-green jade with brownish flaws; spots have been carved into the stone and filled with yellowish dyes. The beast turns its upper body slightly toward one side. The two forepaws are joined,forming an openwork space between them and the chest. The facial features are shown in round relief, while the spine is a raised cylinder. The bifurcated tail is coiled on the hip. The specific beast is difficult to identify from general descriptions in classical texts of the Han to Tang periods. It has been called suanni, tianlu, bixie, baize, or kilin (qilin). What distinguishes these various creatures is uncertain. Han documents recorded that tianlu with one horn and bixie with two horns appeared in pairs on two sides of a tomb; modern historians refer to both as animals with wings. Baize, the spirit of all mythic deities, was said to be a creature thatonly a great emperor could encounter in the east paradise. Suanni, who could run thousands of miles in a day, had the supernatural ability to understand the universe. Kilin (qilin) (the male is called ki, or qi, and the female lin) had a single horn, a deer's body, a cow's tail, and a wolf's claws. Early jade crouching beasts like this example are commonly found in museums and are generally attributed to the Song period (Palace Museum, Beijing 1995, vol. 41, plate 57). Because this beast has no wings, Yang Boda has identified it as a baize.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/27595/preview,"H. 1 in x W. 2 1/2 in x D. 1 1/2 in, H. 2.53 cm x W. 6.35 cm x D. 3.8 cm",,,B75J7,China,,,,Mythic beast (baize)

This is a brilliant finale, a glorious conclusion for an art form that remained energetically alive for almost two millennia. With its low-swung body encircled by raised plain bands and perched on a high conical toot, our hu is a typical Eastern Han variant of this ancient shape.""' Its decor, however, is quite unique. It consists essentially of two friezes placed one on the neck and the other on the foot and showing dragons, birds, rabbits, feathered men and other mythological creatures, flying, dancing or running in a loose setting of spiraling clouds, small tangential circles and comma-shaped volutes. The upper frieze is framed by two narrow bands filled with dots and tangential spirals. The lower frieze is bordered by plain lines. While these designs may be derived from those we noticed in connection with 5th century BCE vessels they closely resemble patterns typical of the lacquer work of the Late Western Han and Eastern Han periods, including some lacquers excavated in Luolang. In this respect, it is interesting to note that our hu was found in Korea.

The highly rounded raised backbone ends in a leaf-shaped tail. The mane, back, legs, and tail are neatly carved with a series of varied incisions. Amber has been known in China since early times. According to Han texts, it was produced in Sichuan, Yunnan, and the north of Burma. Recently, it has also been found in Liaoning and Henan provinces (Luan Bing'ao 1989, 89). Early amber artifacts were small three-dimensional figures in large size proportions, beautifully executed, from the Tang period. Although lions entered China sometime before the Han period, theybegan to be used widely in art only in the Tang period, when exotic culture was much appreciated. The lion was thought to have many virtues—it was hungry but not gluttonous, brave, and faithful—and it was regarded as the king of the animal world. Legend had it that a person to whom the lion threw a ball would be happily dancing and jumping forever. The lion playing with a ball appeared on Song textiles and ceramics.

A hole at the center of the top was drilled from one side. Both faces present the same image: a dragonet with a single horn, a tail, and two cloudlike paws. The body is embellished with transformed clouds consisting of C-, S-, and comma-shaped designs. To enhance the shallow relief, the jade worker has ground off the edges of patterns and used incised intaglio lines and deep grooves. The compositional theme mimics that of an Eastern Zhou jade quite closely. However, several discrepancies are apparent. First, the dragonet is incorrectly proportioned—both too short and too high, with uncharacteristic protrusions around the mouth and the lower belly. The C shape with a hook in the middle is an idea more recent than the Eastern Zhou period. The overlapping of two Cs and two commas is a misinterpretation of two motifs used separately on Warring States jade.

Ritual bronzes were amassed and catalogued, and records of these collections were published using woodblock-print illustrations. Ming and Qing rulers were decidedly more political in their artistic sensibilities, laying claim on the past as a form of legitimacy. This later form of archaism was more complex, as it drew sources not only from bronze vessels of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, but also from Song interpretations of earlier bronzes, ceramics, and jade, thus at times resulting in copies of more ancient copies. By and large, the shapes of Ming and Qing ceramics were based on earlier metal forms, yet their glaze techniques imitated those popular during the more recent Song dynasty.

Among many early uses, the most often mentioned is as a stimulant by people practicing meditation, in both Daoist and Buddhist contexts. By the Tang dynasty (618–907) tea had become a national obsession. The Classic of Tea (Chajing) by Lu Yu (d. 804) expressed a strong preference for green-glazed tea wares to compliment the reddish-brown color of the tea. Most early teas were dark in color, roasted, and made from tea leaves pressed into circular bricks.

Among many early uses, the most often mentioned is as a stimulant by people practicing meditation, in both Daoist and Buddhist contexts. By the Tang dynasty (618–907) tea had become a national obsession. The Classic of Tea (Chajing) by Lu Yu (d. 804) expressed a strong preference for green-glazed tea wares to compliment the reddish-brown color of the tea. Most early teas were dark in color, roasted, and made from tea leaves pressed into circular bricks. Preparation involved grinding tea, boiling water, and tossing tea into the water or pouring the hot water into tea bowls. By the tenth century, use of whipped powdered tea came into vogue.

Both sides show the torso of a dancer. There are three pairs of openwork areas: beside the top of the head, at the ears, and at the waist. The figure lifts the left arm across the top of the head, and holds a draping cloth bundle that seems to protrude from the right ear. Straight, triangular, and incised intaglio lines depict details. The piece was previously identified as a Warring States work from the fifth to the third century bce (d'Argencé 1972, 52–53, plate 19). Three-dimensional human figures and torsos were sculpted from jade as early as the Neolithic period and were executed in thin plaques in the Bronze Age. Archaeological finds of Western Zhou human plaques have thicknesses from 0.3 to 0.6 cm (0.1 to 0.2 in.) (Liu 1996, plates 141–44, 230–31; Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 2, plates 219–20). By the Eastern Zhou period, the thickness of human plaques was reduced; still, human figures in rectangular plaque forms were rarely seen until they reemerged in the Han period (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 4, plates 157–58). All Han jade dancer plaques were represented in a period style: The dancer was standing, one arm lifted and across the head, with a long sleeve draping down over the right shoulder. No fingers were exposed. These were tiny, thin statuettes, and the artisans economically incised simple lines to depict the figures abstractly. Holes were always pierced from both sides at the center of the top and the lower portion. No documented piece was pierced vertically through the cross-section. This is clearly a newer piece. The material used and the high polish are both recent. Aside from its unusual position, the hole was drilled by an electric machine. The half rather than full body view and the exposed hand are representations not used in archaic pieces.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/15024/preview,"H. 1 1/16 in x W. 3/4 in x D. 1/8 in, H. 2.7 cm x W. 1.9 cm x D. .32 cm",,,B60J766,China,,,,Dancer pendant

The craftworker, influenced by stone sculpture techniques, chose round high relief to depict the features but contrasting deep cuts on the head, the claws, and the C shape that lines the shank. The curved tail is rendered with rhythmic lines. Deep incisions in relief delineate the four sets of claws. Excavated and extant jade beasts with one horn and two wings can be categorized into two types: those in a reclining posture, which were said to be paperweights; and those standing, with a hollow body, which were identified as incense burners (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 4, plates 251, 306–7). Presenting a more realistic appearance, this piece retains the single horn but does not have the wings of classical mythic beasts. The posture is reminiscent of Six Dynasties stone sculptures frequently used as tomb guardians; these guardians were later made of clay and jade as well as stone.

The bulky, udder-like, hollow legs communicate directly with a short neck covered by a domed, immovable cover, with a large aperture on one side and a long, cone-shaped spout on the other. To complete this curious profile, a skinny, elbowed handle stands on the side opposite to the spout. The upper part of this handle projects from the thin lip of the neck. On all Middle Shang he - and very few such vessels have been discovered so far - the body decoration is restricted to a narrow band girdling the neck.

The design of this piece suggests carvings of bamboo that had spread from Jiading to all of the country and influenced other crafts. Among the more ingenious works of Jiading artisans were sliced bamboo armrests and plaques. The front face of these works was always polished and carved with decorations; the reverse was often left natural, revealing the raised joints. Many master artisans who practiced bamboo, wood, and jade carving experimented on jade with designs created for bamboo, and soon bamboo joints became beloved elements in jade.

Usually Shang pan have three irregularly shaped perforations where the bowl and feet meet. Late Zhou texts refer to pan as vessels used for ablutions, and the aquatic nature of their main ornamental schemes clearly indicates that they were meant to hold water. These unusual designs and the special cursive way in which they are rendered illustrate a surprising freshness of attitude, a sort of popular vein which is usually absent from all other categories of vessels. The exterior decoration of this pan is somewhat less commonplace than that of the preceding vessel [B60 B1001]. On the bowl itself, a narrow six-panel band contains six dragons confronted, two by two. In front of their spiraling tails and underneath their bellies is a rare motif consisting of a circle with six or seven circular indentations. The foot band is more prosaically decorated with three panels of confronted, winged dragons forming taotie masks with high, sharp central ridges. While the rim is free of any ornament, the inside walls display the same kind of procession mentioned above. The lower part of the walls and the bottom of the bowl are incised with a coiled, snake-like creature whose head is that of a taotie with bottle-shaped horns and large, dome-shaped, protruding eyes, as well as detached nostrils and whiskers. The body of the monster is made of two external strips with I and T-shaped scores (just like typical flanges) and of five strips with scale motifs alternating with plain areas. The most interesting and also the most unexpected aspect of the decor of the bowl taken as a whole is that it presents an unusual admixture of almost casual, perfunctory elements and very minute details. Fully integrated in the design, on the nape of the monster, is an inscription comparable to that of you B60 B996 (see Pl. XV and fig. 18).",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/11581/preview,H. 4 3/8 in x Diam. 12 3/4 in,,,B60B89,"Anyang, China",,,,Basin (pan)

Two of these motifs are particularly conspicuous and are typical of the period, namely the overlapping rows of flattened scales (smaller hu, dou and you ) and the wave band with stylized animal shapes (tall hu and you ). The latter motif illustrates a more advanced stage in the calligraphic trend mentioned in connection with the preceding plate. In addition to two continuous friezes of stepped wave bands, the tall hu (back left, B60B1005) has two lug handles with central ridges.

The large sides display the same concentric ornamental scheme consisting of a whorl-circle surrounded by two ribbons of scale motifs. The underside shows an unusual arrangement of overlapping chevrons, all oriented toward a common center. The long slender neck is incised with four longitudinal scale bands. Similar scale bands appear on the lower part of the bow handle. The top of this handle consists of an animal head with a curled muzzle and a mask incised on its neck. Judging by the well-known Fufeng he discovered in 1963 and other comparable examples, the now missing lid was in the shape of a long-beaked and crested brooding bird.

Conversely, the bulging central part is filled with a continuous decor in fairly high relief on a plain background. The design consists of two large, shielded taotie masks flanked by elaborately crested and taloned birds. Shown in profile and rendered with almost calligraphic liveliness, these birds stand in vivid contrast to the frontal, static, taotie masks and foreshadow the gyrating birds of future generations.

Among many early uses, the most often mentioned is as a stimulant by people practicing meditation, in both Daoist and Buddhist contexts. By the Tang dynasty (618–907) tea had become a national obsession. The Classic of Tea (Chajing) by Lu Yu (d. 804) expressed a strong preference for green-glazed tea wares to compliment the reddish-brown color of the tea. Most early teas were dark in color, roasted, and made from tea leaves pressed into circular bricks. Preparation involved grinding tea, boiling water, and tossing tea into the water or pouring the hot water into tea bowls. By the tenth century, use of whipped powdered tea came into vogue. Light in color, this tea involved nine stages in manufacturing, seven in brewing.

Matsubara groups the piece with two others that lack the atlantean figure and the engraving on the rear.  One, otherwise nearly identical, has an inscription on the rear dated 483 and containing what seems to be a place name, Yingchuan.  The other, without inscription, is partially openwork, leaving open areas at the top of the aureole and on either side of the throne.

Several color combinations—with pigments applied either in underglaze or in colorful overglaze enamels—flourished through the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Multicolor, or “five colors” (wucai), decoration is a term applied to the combination of blue underglaze with three or more overglaze colors. The colors are applied in equal proportions; thus, no single color dominates and a balanced decoration is achieved. During the Ming dynasty, artists developed an unprecedented decorative scheme in which two or more colors were used in combination; this is sometimes called “three colors” (sancai) decoration. Pieces using this technique were produced during the reign of the Kangxi emperor (1662–1722) and are distinctive for their absence of red and their predominance of cooler colors: lavender, light yellow, and/or light green. One hallmark of Ming ceramics is the development of a stable, subtle marigold yellow. Two popular multicolor combination for yellow wares—red over yellow, and green over yellow—were developed during this time, the former employing a red overglaze on a yellow ground, and the latter a green enamel painted directly on a yellow ground.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/16687/preview,"H. 18 1/2 in x W. 6 1/2 in x D. 5 1/8 in, H. 47.1 cm x W. 16.5 cm x D. 13.1 cm",,,B60P295,Northern China,,,,Ridge tile with statue of an arhat (luohan)

This language— utilizing birds, flowers, plants, and landscapes together with color symbolism—continued to evolve and expand during the Qing dynasty, reaching a pinnacle in the 1700s. Technological developments made possible the large variety of sizes, shapes, and decorative techniques of the objects in this case. Specific developments created by Ming artisans—underglaze cobalt blue on a white background and multicolor enameling--attained their most accomplished expression during the Qing dynasty.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/18672/preview,"H. 2 3/8 in x Diam. 5 3/4 in, H. 6 cm x 14.6 cm",,,B60P2086,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",,,,Bowl with design of flowers

An overall pattern of scalloped medallions was woven into the fabric, with a duplicate pattern along the seams of the garment. Each of the medallions encloses a stylized eight-petaled flower. As advanced weaving machines came into use in China in the late nineteenth century, more complex designs were woven into fabric.

A leaf-shaped incision runs from the nose to the high forehead. The bear sits on its tail, which is incised with dense and refined parallel lines. By the Qing period, the image of a bear with a cylinder on its neck was illustrated as a Tang period stand for columns (Liang [approx. 1700–1800] 1965, chap. 38, p. 28). Yet this type of bear has not been found in any archaeological excavations of either Han or Tang tombs. By the Han period, bears made of metal and ceramic commonly served as legs to support vessels, lamps, or architectural models; they were rarely sculpted in jade. Metal and ceramic bear legs found in Han tombs are squat, chunky forms, with no outstretched limbs; none sits on a tail carved in fine detail. The Han bears have a rectangular indent for mounting a vessel on the neck (Xuzhou Museum 1984, 36, fig. 62). Han bears, like other artifacts, had distinctive features rooted in the style of the period. Later reproductions of bears were always modeled after illustrations but were embellished with features reflecting current fashions. This bear's menacing expression and detailed features, such as the leaf-shaped incision on the forehead and the fuzzy tail , were absolutely contrary to Han artistic concepts.

The ancient character she, used for an archer's ring, the prototype of this form, is composed of two radicals, the left representing leather and the right, a roundel, shares the pronunciation of the word for ""shooting."" Ancient archers' rings were leather wrapped around the thumb that drew the bowstring back to shoot an arrow. Early examples made of jade, bone, or horn were wider at one opening than at the other and often had two holes for fastening them to the finger. The fastening is shown in the earliest jade archer's ring discovered in a late Shang tomb in Henan (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 2, plate 111). Very soon jade rings were being produced in many forms and decorated with elaborate motifs. Modern scholars believe that they were too splendid to have been used and that perhaps they functioned as personal ornaments. No archaeological evidence has been found of jade rings from the Tang through the Yuan period. In the Ming period, jade rings were created in two new types. One was a straight-walled band with a rectangular setting on the top(Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plate 218). The other was a slit ring with a top setting inlaid with jade on a gold or silver shank (Shanghai Museum 1985, 541; Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plate 218). Both developed rapidly in varied intricate forms during the Qing period. Thick-walled thumb rings like the one shown here were a modified version of ancient archer rings preserved by the nomadic Manchus, who loved hunting on horseback. Whether such rings were made of jade, gemstone, ceramic, or metal, Manchu noblemen wore them on their right or both thumbs for display.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/20664/preview,"H. 1 1/8 in x Diam. 1 3/8 in x  Diam. opening 3/4 in, H. 2.86 cm x Diam. 3.49 cm x Diam. opening 1.91 cm",,,B62J36,China,,,,Thumb ring

There were three main categories: vessels for food, vessels for wine, and (in far fewer numbers) vessels for water. The most common food appears to have been a stew or gruel, and food vessels often had bowl-like bodies. The food was removed from the vessel with a ladle. Wine was served warm, and many wine vessels had relatively long legs so they could be placed over a fire. Spouts were also required for pouring the wine into cups. The awkward relationship between the usual three legs and two spouts was one of the challenges for the designers of these vessels. Water was apparently used for ritual cleansing, and most water vessels had relatively flat bottoms and low rims.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/58031/preview,"H. 6 1/2 in x W. 13 1/4 in x Diam. 8 7/8 in, H. 16.5 cm x W. 33.7 cm x Diam. 22.5 cm",,,B60B116,China,,,,Ritual food vessel (gui)

Toys were created by hand-sculpting, wheel-finishing, and molding, and frequently were decorated with slip underlying monochrome or polychrome glazes.

With the rise of new philosophical developments, emperors of the Song dynasty desired to align themselves with China’s past rulers, and possession of antique artifacts implied equal stature with the wise rulers of ancient times. Ritual bronzes were amassed and catalogued, and records of these collections were published using woodblock-print illustrations. Ming and Qing rulers were decidedly more political in their artistic sensibilities, laying claim on the past as a form of legitimacy. This later form of archaism was more complex, as it drew sources not only from bronze vessels of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, but also from Song interpretations of earlier bronzes, ceramics, and jade, thus at times resulting in copies of more ancient copies. By and large, the shapes of Ming and Qing ceramics were based on earlier metal forms, yet their glaze techniques imitated those popular during the more recent Song dynasty. Zoomorphic shapes in bronze, intended to emulate Shang and Zhou forms, were embellished with gold flecks or lacquer and often served different purposes from those of their ritual predecessors.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/16764/preview,"H. 14 in x Diam. 7 1/2 in, H. 35.6 cm x Diam. 19.1 cm",,,B60P352,Northern China,,,,Hexagonal vase

There were three main categories: vessels for food, vessels for wine, and (in far fewer numbers) vessels for water. The most common food appears to have been a stew or gruel, and food vessels often had bowl-like bodies. The food was removed from the vessel with a ladle. Wine was served warm, and many wine vessels had relatively long legs so they could be placed over a fire. Spouts were also required for pouring the wine into cups. The awkward relationship between the usual three legs and two spouts was one of the challenges for the designers of these vessels.

This is probably Meng Haoran, who looked for plum blossoms in the snow. A few overhanging cliffs, without any vegetation, provide an austere background. The reverse shows a lone plum tree. Meng Haoran searching for plum blossoms in the snow was a popular theme in the decorative arts of China. The chrysanthemum blooming beneath the donkey provides a clue that this vase was made in the 1900s, when craftworkers were more lax with jade iconography. Traditionally, this scene was supposed to take place in the dead of winter, when the only flower blooming was the plum; so the chrysanthemum had no place.

These practices lost some of their importance with the breakdown of the Zhou government and ritual system. The subsequent social changes corresponded with the beginnings of the use of iron and other changes in technology, and resulted in an increase of wealth among a much broader segment of the population. These new patrons created a demand for luxury items in bronze, jade, lacquer, textile, and other materials. Items of personal adornment in bronze, which had been rare in earlier periods, were created in great numbers. Many were small in scale, elegant, and superbly crafted. Gilding, inlaying, and other decorative techniques also became more common and many items featured inlays of gold, silver, jade, and precious stones. All of these qualities are found in belt hooks, which were used to hang small objects or fasten elaborate belts around loose-fitting embroidered silk robes.

They consist of lotus leaves and lotus pods with petals attached, all growing out from behind the lions.

These donors are dressed in elaborate costumes and shown under canopies, which might be an indication of their high status.  The area between the niches is inscribed with legends giving the names of the donors, who mainly from the Zhao family.

The section below the central scene shows an earth spirit bearing an incense burner and also includes two more scenes.  The one on the right might represent the monk Sariputra with the heavenly maid, while the scene on the left is unidentified. The legends are indecipherable, but the scenes depicted are probably episodes from the Vimalakirtinirdesa Sutra.  Below this section are fifty-six donor figures in individual niches arranged in rows.  Legends next to the niches give their names.  These donors are mainly members of the Zhao family, plus several lay devotees and members of the Buddhist hierarchy.  Below them is a long inscription giving the date of 533.",Sculpture,,,Northern Wei dynasty (386-534),"This stele of a buddha attended by two bodhisattvas provides evidence of how Buddhism was adopted into local belief systems during the Northern Wei dynasty. The backdrop in the shape of a flaming mandorla (body halo) is incised with a variety of iconography, from Buddhist lotus petals, lions, and meditating buddhas, to heavenly birds and dancers carrying censers common to Daoism and the practice of ancestor worship. The base of the stele shows images of six major donors wearing elaborate clothing. The back of the stele depicts a debating scene probably from the VimalakirtiNirdesha sutra and identifies fifty-six donors arranged in rows with each one’s name, a pre-Buddhist practice. These donors are mainly from the Zhao family, plus several lay devotees and members of the Buddhist hierarchy. The nearby placard provides more details about the iconography and imagery on the stele, and transcribes the inscription, which dates the work to 533. Stele of a buddha and two bodhisattvas Each element of this stele has a particular meaning and contributes to the overall content of the piece. The main image is of a buddha attended by two bodhisattvas. The mandorla (body halo) behind them is divided into five different sections. The section nearest the buddha’s head contains lotus petals. The next section outward shows seven buddhas of the past. The top portion of the third section shows a dwarflike earth spirit supporting an incense burner. Each of the two flying heavenly beings hovering above and flanking the incense burner holds an oversized lotus bud. Below them are two heavenly beings playing musical instruments. Lotus pedestals support two more heavenly beings below—the right figure holds an incense burner and a dish of offerings, while the other holds an oversized lotus bud and an incense burner. The scarves of the heavenly beings billow among flowers and tendrils. The pointed portion above this band of heavenly beings contains a meditating buddha on a lotus throne. He is flanked by two more heavenly beings. The outermost section of the mandorla is incised with a close-knit pattern of flames. The base of the stele is incised with images of six donors under canopies wearing elaborate clothing showing their high positions. They stand facing the middle, which is ornamented with a figure bearing an incense burner. The donors’ names are inscribed, most of them from the Zhao family. The back contains fifty-six donor figures, their names—again, mostly members of the Zhao family as well as other devotees and members of the Buddhist hierarchy—and a long inscription giving the date of 533. The legible portions of the inscription read: [In 533] four lay devotees, Zhao Jianxi, Zhao [??], Zhao Wenyin, and Zhao Hongxian, because of their illustrious meritmaking activities from their birth to their death, heaven’s blessings are bestowed on them. For many years their grandfather [?]ying has been well known. He was the leader across the four seas, his influence spread widely, and he was renowned. Therefore, he was able to overcome the three ignorance. . . . All members of Buddhist societies know the three treasures are the best path [to pursuing and] achieving a state of purity. . . . Therefore, if one is donating one’s own funds to make an image, then the merit from the image will be great and [one will] become true Buddhist believers. . . .

Large orchestras played a range of percussion, string, and woodwind instruments. Most were made of wood and other perishable materials and have long since vanished. However, large sets of bells have been discovered, and these provide insights into the complexity of Zhou-dynasty court music. The set unearthed from the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng has sixty-five bells, with the largest one more than five feet tall. Bronze ritual bells found in tombs were arranged in sets, called bianzhong. A complete set could include three types of bells, sorted in groups from large to small. The most common types of bells in the Eastern Zhou period (770–256 BCE) were yongzhong, which have a long columnar handle on the top, and niuzhong, which have a semicircular knob instead of a handle. Found less frequently, bozhong generally have loop handles, a flat bottom, and a rounder body. Bell sets with as many as sixty-five pieces, the largest more than five feet in height, have been discovered in Eastern Zhou-period aristocratic tombs.

The relief depicts a man with a walking stick crossing a narrow bridge toward a thatched pavilion under pine trees. This scene was likely adapted from a painting on the traditional subject of the scholar living in seclusion. Such depictions celebrate the leisure moments after retreat from urban life, often depicting the scholar strolling along a riverbank in search of nature and peace. Jade is so hard it cannot be carved; it must be abraded, a slow and painstaking process. Creating landscape scenes on jade is challenging and was not common until the 1500s. Even at that time, effects such as those conveyed by ink washes in a landscape painting were impossible to create in jade. Instead, jade workers relied on deep or shallow relief, openwork, and intricate cutting to create landscapes that were unique to their medium.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/24395/preview,H. 5 1/2 in x W. 2 1/2 in,,,B70J9,China,,,,Table screen with a scene of seclusion in mountains
images/asian_chinese3551.jpg,Gift of R.W. Winskill in Memory of Lionel L. Pries,,Nephrite,,,,Not on view,Chinese Art,,,,Jade And Stones,,,"Qing dynasty (1644-1911), Reign of the Qianlong emperor (1736-1795)","Two rectangles of white translucent hetian jade have been fashioned into a belt set. The squared hook shaped like a dragon in relief fits perfectly through a slot on the buckle. The base of thehook has a round stud; the buckle has an oval hole on one side and an elliptical stud on its base. A contorted dragonet carrying a floral branch in its mouth is crafted in openwork relief on the tops of the two facing squares. The line work of the details is remarkable in its refined incisions and deep grooves. Buckles developed at the same time as belt hooks, from an early Han style with a fixed or movable prong. The movable prong, attached to one side of a round, square, or irregular frame, became the standard form throughout history. Buckles with only an open frame on one side, and no prong, were a later version. The earliest jade buckles with no prong have been discovered not in Han but in early Ming tombs (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plate 199). Several jade buckles with round frames now in the Palace Museum, Beijing, collection have been attributed to the Song, the Jin, and the Yuan periods (960–1368) (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plates 79, 80, 158–59). Among these, two sets, each consisting of a hook and a buckle with an opening, were identified as Yuan belt sets (Palace Museum, Beijing 1995, vol. 42, plates 71, 72, 74, 138, 145). The dragon's head was functional, not just decorative; it hooked directly into the opening on the buckle.

One face consists of three divisions, each repeating a central roundel surrounded by three C-shaped clouds. The other face shows the classical grain design with raised bosses. Due to technical shortcomings, the depressions along the edges of the C shapes and the background that has been carved away to raise the relief grains are not flat and smooth. This later reproduction of a Han-style disc has features that do not correspond to the early period. The proportion between the thickness and the diameter is not standard, and most Han discs are adorned with the same design on both surfaces. Later copies tended to make the discs more interesting by carving several different patterns on one. The repeating arrangement of three C shapes framing a circle was also not seen in the Han period.

These bones, primarily the shoulder blades of cattle and the undershells of turtles, were dried and had holes drilled in them at regular intervals. A question was directed to an ancestor by applying a hot poker to these holes to make the surface crack. A specialist, usually a king or a member of a ruling family, would then read the appearance of the cracks to obtain the ancestor’s response. Both the question—in positive and negative forms—and the results were written on the surface of the oracle bone.

Along with the bird, the hare is frequently found as a subject for pendant plaques during the Western Zhou dynasty; it is rarely, if ever found in jades of the Shang dynasty. In later times the hare became associated with the moon and the elixir of immortality. It is difficult to say if that iconography had developed as early as the Western Zhou, but the frequent appearance of this animal in the arts of the period does suggest an increasing importance in Zhou culture. This piece is a flat silhouette with minimal surface ornamentation. Details are limited to a large circular eye, long ear, and the legs and feet. The points of attachment on this hare pendant indicate it was suspended from its nose. It would perhaps have joined a series of other hares along with beads and other pieces to form a complete necklace or other form of personal ornamentation. There is an uncompleted perforation on one side of the lower part of the animal's body. Like the cormorant discussed above, this rabbit is cut from a tan jade of a type that is generally associated with sources in Khotan. Some discoloration has occurred in burial and one side is matte and opaque. The other side was less affected and has a greater degree of gloss and translucence. In this and other entries finish is used to refer to the refinement and completeness of the cutting and other workmanship.

The holes cut under the beaks of the bird and one on the side indicate that this piece functioned as part of a pendant. The central hole is outlined by a slightly raised area except for an area directly at the bottom. From there a small, undecorated section continues to the lowest area on the piece. This suggests a wider piece of material, perhaps a ribbon, was suspended from this central hole. The surface decoration on the piece is rather cursory, consisting of little more than shallowly incised parallel lines making up a series of curves and volutes. The lines themselves are rough and unfinished, perhaps suggesting a piece of secondary importance or of provincial manufacture. The piece is thinly cut from a piece of very light yellow Khotan jade. The stone is of decent quality with some darker inclusions, and some cloudy areas. Despite the unfinished appearance of the decoration, the surface is highly polished.

A dragon's head looking backward forms the hook. The square handle has a dragonet in relief on the top and two rectangular studs and incised leaf designs on the base. Wide bevel cutting, refined line work in intaglio, and cross-hatching were added on the shallow relief. A type of bronze belt hook with a shovel-shaped handle appeared in Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, and Shaanxi during the Eastern Zhou period. The shape was particularly favored by the Lu and Jin states, but its historic development has not been thoroughly studied. The head of a duck or a beast formed the hook. Some handle tops were plain; others were decorated with relief or inlay depicting birds, dragons, monster masks, or transformed clouds (Wang 1985, 283, fig. 9). Two published jade pieces were designed after metal works. A piece from Henan, dated to the late Spring and Autumn Period, bears stylized dragon and cloud designs.

Fish pendants proliferated among the Shang and the Western Zhou inhabitants of the Central Plains and the northwest (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 2, plates 96, 115, 128). They became standardized in simple forms with a straight or curved body, the fins incised with short vertical strokes. The outer contour of the fish is simple and streamlined; only after the Spring and Autumn Period did a few notches appear on the edges to accent the depiction of the mouth and the lower jaw (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 2, plates 8–9). With a few circular exceptions, Shang and Zhou fish had no horizontal lines along the length of the body. One hole was drilled at the head, and one or two at the tail. The diadem-shaped design of the dorsal fins and the horizontal lines in this piece reveal a later artisan's misunderstanding of the iconography. The tool marks in the holes indicate machine finishing.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/15331/preview,"H. 1 1/8 in x W. 3 1/2 in x D. 1/16 in, H. 2.9 cm x W. 8.9 cm x D. .16 cm Diameter of hole 1/16 in",,,B60J942,China,,,,Fish pendant

It was also a time of great philosophical, social, and technological change. The use of iron first became widespread during this period, and this, combined with advances in agriculture, allowed for a degree of prosperity at many levels of society. Reflecting the richness of the period, a variety of stylistic trends developed in bronze vessels. Definite regional styles coexisted with popular styles across regions; the highest-quality vessels, some of which were very large or had elaborately inlaid surfaces, were produced alongside simple and crudely cast vessels.

A fascinating study of changes in fashion and ideals of feminine beauty can be made by examining these tomb models. The human figurines in these tombs were arranged in a definite hierarchy. Models of servants and support staff were arranged along the floors and niches. Images of the deceased and his or her peers, as well as admired historical personalities and divine beings, were painted, carved in stone, or impressed in the clay tiles that made up the sarcophagus and the walls of the tomb chamber.

This gold surface layer was then burnished with a hard, smooth metal or stone tool to make it more compact and shiny.

It reads: Bo (fathers elder brother) made for his accomplished deceased father (this) sacrificial vessel.  May his sons and grandsons treasure (it) forever.,Metal Arts,,,Western Zhou period (approx. 1050-771 BCE),"These vessels do not share the conservatism of the lei of the preceding plate (B60B450) and as such are more explicit examples of the Mid Western Zhou styles. They introduce a set of new silhouettes, all characterized by a certain squatness and sagging of the contours, as well as a set of unprecedented ornamental schemes. Two of these motifs are particularly conspicuous and are typical of the period, namely the overlapping rows of flattened scales (smaller hu, dou and you ) and the wave band with stylized animal shapes (tall hu and you ). The latter motif illustrates a more advanced stage in the calligraphic trend mentioned in connection with the preceding plate. The scale motifs which cover the larger part of the lid and the body of the sagging you (front right, B60B146) stand in flat relief against a background of fine raised lines. So does the wave band with heart shapes on the neck. A reduced, simplified version of this band appears at the base of the larger tubular knob of the lid. The outer sides of the ""ears"" of the lid are incised with barbed spirals. The top of the slender but wide bow handle is divided into four sections by small ridges. Each section contains a long-tailed' crested bird. Both ends of the handle sport disproportionately large ovine heads with curled horns. Similar heads in reduced scales appear in axial position on the neck band. Somehow the birds of the handle and these heads seem to be out of style because they are the only zoomorphic elements in a geometrical context. It is with such vessels that one appreciates the full value of the drastic changes that occurred during the middle Western Zhou period. The same twelve-character inscription was carved inside the lid and on the bottom of the vessel (fig. 54). It reads: ""Bo (father's elder brother) made for his accomplished deceased father (this) sacrificial vessel.

Unlike ceramic bowls, whose rounded lips either tapered or were bound with metal, these jade versions are punctuated by a beveled edge, which highlights the artisan's control over the hard stone. As is typical for covered bowls of this type, the shallow lid sits inside the flared lip of the deeper bowl and is itself surmounted by a small foot ring so that it too may be used as a bowl when inverted. Like their porcelain prototypes, these vessels have thin sides that exploit the translucence of the material. This commonality between jade and porcelain may help explain the popularity of jade skeuomorphs (decorative versions) of porcelain pieces that began to appear in the eighteenth century once jade supplies were plentiful enough to support the production of vessels.

With the rise of new philosophical developments, emperors of the Song dynasty desired to align themselves with China’s past rulers, and possession of antique artifacts implied equal stature with the wise rulers of ancient times. Ritual bronzes were amassed and catalogued, and records of these collections were published using woodblock-print illustrations. Ming and Qing rulers were decidedly more political in their artistic sensibilities, laying claim on the past as a form of legitimacy. This later form of archaism was more complex, as it drew sources not only from bronze vessels of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, but also from Song interpretations of earlier bronzes, ceramics, and jade, thus at times resulting in copies of more ancient copies. By and large, the shapes of Ming and Qing ceramics were based on earlier metal forms, yet their glaze techniques imitated those popular during the more recent Song dynasty.

These pieces are quite close replicas of Shang dynasty zun, a shape that had only rarely been used as a model for earlier archaistic jades. Almost every detail of the decoration—the taotie masks on the chests, the coiled snakes that double as wings, the kui dragons that curl around the body, the bird-feather and leiwen grounds—are directly copied from Shang and early Zhou models. This suggests that the artisan who created these pieces had direct access to Shang bronzes. Shanghai was a center for the collecting of early bronzes and large-scale pieces in jadeite.

His ability to portray animals realistically, adopted from Western oil paintings, must have influenced his contemporaries.

Certain ancient types among Song official productions (960 –1279) were continuously copied. Ming official factories never stopped experimenting with varieties of new glazes, strains, and decorative devices to maintain porcelain's dominance over other ceremonial materials. A group of tablewares from the Avery Brundage collection illustrates four types of monochrome glazes produced in the Ming imperial factories in Jingdezhen from the early fifteenth through the sixteenth centuries. The Yongle emperor chose the color white and Islamic metalwork–inspired forms to be used at altars and imperial temples. The fifteenth-century white glaze, soupy and smooth, is knownas ""sweet white."" The dark blue glaze, favored by earlier Mongol rulers, was successfully reproduced during the Xuande period. Blue was often used in ritual celebrations on sacrificial altars. Eloquent names, such as ""gemstone blue"" and ""celestial blue,"" were documented. Yellow, viewed as a noble color, became fashionable in the late fifteenth century. This low-fire glaze could cover a previously fired white glaze for refiring, or coat a clay body for only one firing. The yellow wares presented to the Chenghua and Zhengde courts exhibit a delicate body and refined texture with sensitive color tone, winning the admirable description ""chicken fat."" The brown glaze resulted from an experiment in the Xuande reign, when official porcelain manufacturers attempted to re-create the brown glaze of a type of ancient Ding ware that had once been presented to the Northern Song court. On Ming imperial porcelain, brown glaze that glimmered on the surface with a shiny metallic luster was called ""purple gold,"" after the description for brown Song Ding ware. Matte brown glaze was referred to as ""soybean paste.""",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/17835/preview,"H. 2 5/8 in x Diam. 5 1/4 in, H. 6.7 cm x Diam. 13.5 cm",,,B60P1760,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",,,,Bowl with brown glaze

These practices lost some of their importance with the breakdown of the Zhou government and ritual system. The subsequent social changes corresponded with the beginnings of the use of iron and other changes in technology, and resulted in an increase of wealth among a much broader segment of the population. These new patrons created a demand for luxury items in bronze, jade, lacquer, textile, and other materials. Items of personal adornment in bronze, which had been rare in earlier periods, were created in great numbers. Many were small in scale, elegant, and superbly crafted. Gilding, inlaying, and other decorative techniques also became more common and many items featured inlays of gold, silver, jade, and precious stones. All of these qualities are found in belt hooks, which were used to hang small objects or fasten elaborate belts around loose-fitting embroidered silk robes. From the objects in this case you will see that bronze, iron, and jade served as bases for these belt hooks.

The relief design is the same on both sides—grain comma spirals in the center and stylized C shapes on the border, all framed by a single incised line. A hole has been drilled in the center of the top. This chape was believed to be a Warring States Period work (d'Argencé 1972, 46, plate 16). The decoration of Han chapes preserved much of the Warring States style. Comma spirals and larger C hooks were arranged in a very logical and stylized way. The one or three holes in the top were generally in a cow-nostril form, with one bigger opening and a smaller bottom ( Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 4, plate 84). The jade artisan did not remove the background of the raised C shapes evenly on this chape, and the comma spirals with deep intaglio do not correspond to the Han technique. In addition, the composition is loose, without the strict alignment seen on Han jades.

Each face bears C-shaped designs in shallow relief. Both side edges are cut by three C-shaped indents. The term le in the first dictionary, Shuowen Jieji, was classified to the secondary stone to jade. The two tubular beads with central holes illustrated in Wu Dazheng's 1889 catalogue of jade were annotated as round le, serving as pommels on the handles of whips (Teng 1992a , 146). Na Zhiliang (1982, 211, no. 1478) thought that jade le were adaptations of a type of bone ornament. Different forms—straight cylindrical beads, tubular beads with two flaring ends, or plaques with tapering ends (an oblate shape) and a central hole—are all identified as le in modern archaeology. The earliest was the cylindrical form, which has been commonly found in Neolithic sites. Tubular beads with flaring ends have come from Shang and Zhou sites, emerging from archaeological excavations of Eastern Zhou tombs (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 3, plates 105–7). The type shown here, with a rectangular front view and an oblate profile, was usually decorated with shallow relief on front and back faces and indents on side edges. The hole identifies it as an ornament that was fastened to something else. This piece is a Qing reproduction of an Eastern Zhou style. Under a microscope, the surface clearly reveals artificially created spots filled with residue. The rough inner walls of these penetrations suggest manual tool work. The composition is rather loose, and the C forms are soft compared to Eastern Zhou designs.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/27466/preview,"H. 7/8 in x W. 1 1/2 in x D. 5/16 in, H. 2.22 cm x W. 3.81 cm x D. .8 cm Diameter of hole 1/8 in",,,B73J3,China,,,,Plaque ornament (le)

Particular flowers or combinations of birds and flowers were often chosen less for their intrinsic beauty than for their symbolic meaning. As a result, Ming and Qing artisans became successful in blending decorative motifs from multiple sources into a consistent, cohesive visual language. This language— utilizing birds, flowers, plants, and landscapes together with color symbolism—continued to evolve and expand during the Qing dynasty, reaching a pinnacle in the 1700s.

Certain ancient types among Song official productions (960 –1279) were continuously copied. Ming official factories never stopped experimenting with varieties of new glazes, strains, and decorative devices to maintain porcelain's dominance over other ceremonial materials. A group of tablewares from the Avery Brundage collection illustrates four types of monochrome glazes produced in the Ming imperial factories in Jingdezhen from the early fifteenth through the sixteenth centuries. The Yongle emperor chose the color white and Islamic metalwork– inspired forms to be used at altars and imperial temples. The fifteenth-century white glaze, soupy and smooth, is known as ""sweet white."" The dark blue glaze, favored by earlier Mongol rulers, was successfully reproduced during the Xuande period. Blue was often used in ritual celebrations on sacrificial altars. Eloquent names, such as ""gemstone blue"" and ""celestial blue,"" were documented. Yellow, viewed as a noble color, became fashionable in the late fifteenth century. This low-fire glaze could cover a previously fired white glaze for refiring, or coat a clay body for only one firing. The yellow wares presented to the Chenghua and Zhengde courts exhibit a delicate body and refined texture with sensitive color tone, winning the admirable description ""chicken fat."" The brown glaze resulted from an experiment in the Xuande reign, when official porcelain manufacturers attempted to re-create the brown glaze of a type of ancient Ding ware that had once been presented to the Northern Song court. On Ming imperial porcelain, brown glaze that glimmered on the surface with a shiny metallic luster was called ""purple gold,"" after the description for brown Song Ding ware. Matte brown glaze was referred to as ""soybean paste.""",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/18678/preview,"H. 1 5/8 in x Diam. 8 1/4 in, H. 4.2 cm x Diam. 21 cm",,,B60P2087,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",,,,Plate with blue glaze

With the rise of new philosophical developments, emperors of the Song dynasty desired to align themselves with China’s past rulers, and possession of antique artifacts implied equal stature with the wise rulers of ancient times. Ritual bronzes were amassed and catalogued, and records of these collections were published using woodblock-print illustrations. Ming and Qing rulers were decidedly more political in their artistic sensibilities, laying claim on the past as a form of legitimacy. This later form of archaism was more complex, as it drew sources not only from bronze vessels of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, but also from Song interpretations of earlier bronzes, ceramics, and jade, thus at times resulting in copies of more ancient copies. By and large, the shapes of Ming and Qing ceramics were based on earlier metal forms, yet their glaze techniques imitated those popular during the more recent Song dynasty.

Surviving paintings, architecture, and sculpture made of perishable materials are rare, but some traces can be found in Japan, where more artwork and structures of the same period have survived. Small-scale gilded bronze objects also allow valuable insight into the magnificence of this sculptural tradition. Although there is no inscribed identification, the Buddha of the altar set is probably Amitābha, judging from his mudra and gesture. However, the iconography of the two accompanying bodhisattvas (the moon and sun discs in their respective hands) suggests that the central deity would be Bhaiṣajyaguru, the ""Healing Buddha"". A close examination very strongly suggests that the two bodhisattvas and at least one of the attendants are additions from another altar to make this set looks complete by a dealer or collector.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/12814/preview,"H. 10 3/8 in x W. 5 5/8 in x D. 3 3/4 in, H. 26.4 cm x W. 14.3 cm x D. 9.5 cm",,,B60B1038,China,,,,"A buddha, probably Amitābha, flanked by bodhisattvas and attendants"

Liu Hai, Immortal and God of Wealth, is seen on a rocky ledge. He is seated with one leg folded beneath him and his hand resting on his raised right knee, a pose more closely associated with Guanyin, the Buddhist Lord of Mercy. His attribute, the string of cash, is hung around his neck. This is what he uses to tease his toad, which likes to disappear once in a while. Liu Hai looks benignly at his three-legged toad, which appears on the ledge below. The warty toad turns to his master, billowing clouds from its mouth. Above Liu Hai is a two-story pavilion built below a towering crag incised with a pair of flying bats, a symbol of blessings. A tall pine tree on the right balances the composition; its bark and pine needles are clearly defined. A small tree with rounded leaves grows along the crevices, as do other small plants. A wall and gateway appear in the back, and trees grow precariously among the rocks. Soapstone is a much softer material than jade, and lends itself to delicate carving. This is a fine piece of sculpture with remarkable attention to details. The pine needles are unusual—they do not follow the traditional motif used by jade craft workers in the 1700s and 1800s. Instead of an oval with lines radiating from the center, the pine needles appear in fan-shaped clusters with lines radiating from the bottom, the way they would have appeared in a painting.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/28175/preview,"H. 7 1/2 in x W. 6 3/4 in x D. 4  1/4 in, H. 19.0 cm x W. 17.1 cm x D. 10.8 cm",,,B81J2,China,,,,Mystic isle

Short parallel cuts are used on the trunk, which curls up to the right. Depressions below deeply incised toenails suggest the undersides of the four feet. The most phenomenal periods of cultural growth occurred during two important eras of the Song and the Ming, in which objects for the scholar's' studio rose in prestige. One of those objects, ' a paperweight made of any heavy material, served both practical and aesthetic functions.

The design on this piece is typical of archaeological finds from tombs in Guangdong, Liaoning, and Jiangsu provinces, dating from the Spring and Autumn Period (770–481 bce) of the Eastern Zhou to the Eastern Han period (25–220 ce). The stud on early examples was close to the end opposite the dragon's head, but in later pieces it gradually moved toward the center of the handle (Wang 1985, 284, figs. 12, 15–18). The dragons' heads on early jades always looked back 180 degrees, but from the Eastern Zhou period (770–256 bce) they began turning at angles between 180 and 90 degrees.

Particular flowers or combinations of birds and flowers were often chosen less for their intrinsic beauty than for their symbolic meaning. As a result, Ming and Qing artisans became successful in blending decorative motifs from multiple sources into a consistent, cohesive visual language. This language— utilizing birds, flowers, plants, and landscapes together with color symbolism—continued to evolve and expand during the Qing dynasty, reaching a pinnacle in the 1700s.

This can be verified by cizhou type vases with a similar rounded body with a short neck (Inst. Sil. 1982: 295-6, illu. 63: 4). The function of the shape has been interpreted as either funerary (because grain has been found inside pieces that were buried into tombs) or as a water container used to offer farmers a drink through straws inserted into the tubes.

Of particular note are certain ceramic wares used specifically for sculpture: Dehua, Zhangzhou, Shiwan, and Yixing wares, all named for and characteristic of the places in which they were made. Dehua wares, known in the West since the 1700s as blanc de Chine (“China white”), were produced in Dehua, in southeastern China’s Fujian province. Technical improvements achieved in the 1500s for obtaining and purifying the milk-white glaze and ivory-white clay made possible the sculpting of large figures in porcelain. Zhangzhou wares—those attributed to the Zhangzhou kiln, also in Fujian province—are distinctive for their crackled ivory-colored glaze. The Shiwan kilns at Foshan, Guangdong province in southern China produced wares with thick bodies and colorful glazes, especially known in the West as flambé (suffused) glazes. Sculptural figures and architectural ceramics are particularly significant in Shiwan ware. Clay found at Yixing, Jiangsu province in southeastern China was used to create ceramics in a characteristic range of dark colors—from brown, purple, and green to buff and beige. Yixing ceramics are known to enhance the color, fragrance, and taste of tea; therefore, the majority of Yixing ware is in the form of tea sets.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/62069/preview,"H. 18 3/4 in x W. 12 7/8 in x D. 13 in, H. 47.7 cm x W. 32.9 cm x D. 33.1 cm",,,B61P13+,"Zhangzhou, Fujian province, China",,,,Seated figure of the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (Guanyin)

The bottom is now usually rounded, the sides straight or convex, the uprights frequently have semicircular or round columns and caps that can assume a variety of shapes, including those of cones, domes or inverted beakers. Of all the exceptional features displayed by our third jue (left, B60B1049), the most spectacular may well be its ox-headed lid. The knob of the lid is a plain tube. Its top is decorated with two addorsed gaping and taloned dragons with bottle-shaped horns on the "" neck,"" immediately behind the head, and, on the ""tail'' with blades of confronted dragons that are taloned; gaping and ascending. Under the spout is a ""dragonized"" cicada and under the tail a rising blade with two confronted, taloned and descending dragons. On the neck, between spout and tail, five small rising blades contain stylized animal shapes. Curiously enough, there are not one, but two tiers of decoration on the body, the main zone being separated from the neck by a narrow ribbon with I and T-shaped scores. The main zone consists of four taloned and crested dragons confronted two by two and framed by the handle on one side and on the other three sides by triangular flanges with incised chevron patterns; another unusual feature. The outside of the legs are incised with elongated hanging blades comprising stylized animal shapes. The caps of the uprights are in the shape of coiled, scaled dragons with their heads in the round. The upper part of the bow-shaped handle has a bovine head also in the round, and echoing that of the lid. The space behind the handle, usually reserved for an inscription, is here tilled by a large incised cicada. The vessel bears two identical, nine-graph inscriptions, one cast inside the lid, the other one on the inside wall of the body. The first graph of this inscription is ( zi for ""son(s)""). The second represents a spurred leg in a marsh or a rice field and is probably a clan name. The third is ( zai : "" at'). The fourth is thought to be an old form of (B ang : ""state,"" ""country"").

The inlay technique is called “flat application” (pingtuo) in which tiny pre-cut pieces of mother-of-pearl of varying thickness, forms, and sizes are carefully arranged over a lacquered surface. This ornamental technique reached its peak during the first half of the Qing dynasty, when both Manchu and Han nobility appreciated this kind of bright and shiny decoration on the furniture in their residences. A cabinet of this kind was likely produced at a court workshop during the reign of the Kangxi emperor (1662–1722), a time of military expansion and power in China. Depicted on the two doors of this cabinet are mountain bandits paying tribute to the governmental military. The cabinet celebrates that power and wealth. The side panels of this cabinet show graceful scenes of outdoor activities, scholarly pursuits, and flower gardens. These ornamental scenes clearly conveyed a meaning of privilege and cultivation to visitors who might see them.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/73271/preview,H. 87 1/2 in x W. 56 1/2 in x D. 26 1/4 in,,,B69M4,China,,,,Large cabinet

High-fired with a lustrous glaze (having low iron content) on a thin, white body with incised or molded designs, Qingbai wares have acquired a reputation of being like jade, which historically came in a range of pale colors in addition to the jade green we think of today.

The range of decorative motifs found on gong vessels is particularly broad as it includes quadrupeds, reptiles, birds, and even at times human elements. Such wealth and variety seem to reflect an attempt to produce a syncretic vessel illustrating all the main aspects of the Shang pantheon. Simultaneously, this whole category of vessels is dominated by a type of association quite unique in Shang art: that of a horned quadruped and an owl-like bird standing on fairly equal terms. More streamlined and better integrated than the two previous specimens [B60B1032 and B60B1004], the third gong illustrated here (bottom right, B60B976) is also more convincingly zoomorphic. The ovine head of the front part of the lid is counterbalanced on the rear by a large-eyed, two-crested bird. On each side of the lid the remaining space is occupied by an elongated, crested bird with a ribbon-like bifurcated tail. Two large birds of the same type fill three-quarters of the body proper and extend well into the foot zone of the vessel. The bow-shaped spurred handle is surmounted by a smaller, simplified version of the ovine head of the lid. The inside of the lid and the bottom of the vessel bear cast-in, three-graph, almost identical inscriptions.

With the rise of new philosophical developments, emperors of the Song dynasty desired to align themselves with China’s past rulers, and possession of antique artifacts implied equal stature with the wise rulers of ancient times. Ritual bronzes were amassed and catalogued, and records of these collections were published using woodblock-print illustrations. Ming and Qing rulers were decidedly more political in their artistic sensibilities, laying claim on the past as a form of legitimacy. This later form of archaism was more complex, as it drew sources not only from bronze vessels of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, but also from Song interpretations of earlier bronzes, ceramics, and jade, thus at times resulting in copies of more ancient copies. By and large, the shapes of Ming and Qing ceramics were based on earlier metal forms, yet their glaze techniques imitated those popular during the more recent Song dynasty.

Many of these designs consist of composite or wholly imaginary animals. On bronze vessels of the Shang dynasty, the most frequently seen of these animals is the taotie, a composite dragon-like animal whose body has been split down the middle and splayed out on both sides of the head. The head of the taotie has large eyes, horns, and a gaping mouth; the body at times has only one pair of legs. As the gong illustrates, in later periods of the Shang dynasty the taotie was joined by a wide range of dragons, birds, and other animals, both real and imaginary. What meaning did the taotie have? Some scholars believe that it evolved from decorative patterns and had no real meanings. Others argue that a motif as prominent as the taotie must have been central to the culture’s world view.

The main decorative motifs of the cylindrical vessel (B60B1002) have incised details and stand in fairly high relief against a dense background or fine meanders. The cover consists of a mushroom-shaped knob, a dome and a vertical rim. The knob is incised with a whorl-circle. The dome is divided into four sections by flanges with I and T-shaped scores. Two or these flanges serve as axes for four taloned, confronted dragons forming taotie masks. The vertical rim, which is equipped with two pointed tongues fitting in notches located on the mouth rim, is really treated as an upper neck band, as amply indicated by the presence of the sharp overhanging ridge that separates it from the dome. This vertical rim is divided into four panels by small, vertical ridges. Each panel contains a couple of bunked dragon; with heart-shaped ears. The body proper displays one main and three secondary zones of decoration. The neck belt contains four sections delineated by two axial animal heads in high relief and by the tenons of the handle. Each section is decorated with a regardant dragon whose single horn is bottle-shaped. The upper belly band is also divided into four panels by scored flanges with a single spur. Each panel comprises a couple of beaked dragons. The lower belly band, which is also the main zone of decoration. i, similarly partitioned by flanges with two spurs in the upper section. Four large taloned dragons are confronted two by two to form taotie masks with hilt-shaped shields. Each of the four panels of the narrow foot band contains two dragons similar to those or the lid but presented counterclockwise. Only the upper part of the bow-shaped handle is decorated. Four sections, delineated by three lozenges in high relief and by the terminal animal heads in the round, display the same unusual motif that can be interpreted as a horned cicada.

They introduce a set of new silhouettes, all characterized by a certain squatness and sagging of the contours, as well as a set of unprecedented ornamental schemes. Two of these motifs are particularly conspicuous and are typical of the period, namely the overlapping rows of flattened scales (smaller hu, dou and you ) and the wave band with stylized animal shapes (tall hu and you ). The latter motif illustrates a more advanced stage in the calligraphic trend mentioned in connection with the preceding plate. In bronze the dou (B60B949) does not seem to have been in use prior to the 9th century BCE, even though this shape is found in pottery as early as the Neolithic period. The bowl of this rare vessel is very shallow. The vertical outer wall or the bowl is deeply recessed underneath, and this recession is perforated with four large rectangular openings which do not seem to have any functional value. On the outside of the bowl and below two incised parallel lines, eight big and dome-like whorl-circles alternate with eight geometrical patterns in low relief. These patterns consist of four barbed, C-shaped spirals.

Among many early uses, the most often mentioned is as a stimulant by people practicing meditation, in both Daoist and Buddhist contexts. By the Tang dynasty (618–907) tea had become a national obsession. The Classic of Tea (Chajing) by Lu Yu (d. 804) expressed a strong preference for green-glazed tea wares to compliment the reddish-brown color of the tea. Most early teas were dark in color, roasted, and made from tea leaves pressed into circular bricks. Preparation involved grinding tea, boiling water, and tossing tea into the water or pouring the hot water into tea bowls. By the tenth century, use of whipped powdered tea came into vogue. Light in color, this tea involved nine stages in manufacturing, seven in brewing.

Ancient ceramics, sometimes in near-pristine condition, have continued to appear in local Southeast Asian markets in recent years. Often these pieces were discovered by fishers, who pulled up objects when trawling the ocean floor. The ceramics in their nets came from some of the many shipwrecks that can still be found in the waterways where, centuries ago, huge ships carried cargoes of trade wares. In the past few decades, underwater archaeologists have been able to scientifically excavate several of these shipwrecks, providing us with invaluable information not only about the types of ceramics produced but also about larger patterns of maritime trade. Although China dominated the maritime ceramic trade for centuries, shipwrecks containing cargoes full of wares from Thailand and Vietnam indicate the growing competition from Southeast Asia for the export market.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/4053/preview,"H. 2 in x Diam. 6 in, H. 5.1 cm x Diam. 15.2 cm",,,2000.25,"Changsha, Hunan province, China",,,,Bowl with flowers

The shorter one is a square-faceted column with a flat bottom. At the top sits a high-relief lion above a meander encircling the column. Shallow-relief scenes with calligraphy titles decorate the sides: willows on a riverbank, entitled ""waves by green willows,"" and blown willows, described as ""by the river,"" on two sides; the pleasure of a fisherman, accompanied by the title ""small boat,"" and a ""fishhook"" on the other two sides. All the calligraphy is rendered in raised characters, but the background around them is coarsely executed and not very flat. The simple, strong grooves display an early style. This piece can be used as both a hairpin and a personal seal. A Ming tomb in Shanghai contained similar jade hairpins in white jade, with the seal of a lion in relief above a meander circle (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plate 220). The longer hairpin has a rounded column, tapering slightly to a blunt rounded end. Strong curved cuts define a scene of a dragonet (young dragon) amid fungi on the surface and the domed top, under which two characters spell Zigang in raised cursive script. Lu Zigang (late 1500s) probably came from Taicang county in Jiangsu province and settled in the jade craft center at Suzhou. He was well known in the late Ming as a great jade master, and his work has been widely reproduced. The local annals of Suzhou and Taicang (compiled between 1800 and 1900) record that Lu made jade hairpins with two designs: narcissus plants whose stems were as delicate and refined as human hair; and raised calligraphy containing more than one character on each piece. Only one hairpin, from the National Palace Museum, Taipei, has been published as a documented narcissus pin (Teng 1981, 77, plate 10). The piece shown here bears the ""raised calligraphy"" and his name, but the execution lacks the refined quality seen on most Zigang-attributed jades.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/20695/preview,"(a) H. 3 5/8 in, H. 9.21 cm (b) H. 2 3/8 in, H. 6.03 cm",,,B62J50.a-.b,China,,,,Two hairpins

This technique, known as “mercury gilding,” involved an application of a paste-like mixture of gold and mercury on bronze to create a gilded surface, which also gave the metal greater resistance to tarnishing. The bronze was heated by charcoal fire to evaporate the mercury, leaving the gold bonded to its surface. This gold surface layer was then burnished with a hard, smooth metal or stone tool to make it more compact and shiny. The use of gold on bronze in China dates back more than two thousand years, and this high-cost technique was traditionally used for luxurious decorations and icons. Many bronze-cast buddha and bodhisattva statues were adorned with this gilding technique to attract more devotees. Small, lustrous figures and icons like these in the cases were carried for spiritual protection on journeys and placed on household altars for worship. It is important to note that many altar shrines were made in segments and then assembled, and so over the centuries some have lost attachments or have had parts from similar-sized works reattached.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/11785/preview,"H. 7 in x W. 3 in x Diam. 5 in, H. 17.8 cm x W. 7.6 cm x Diam. 12.7 cm",,,B60B248,China,,,,The First seven steps of the Buddha-to-be

With the rise of new philosophical developments, emperors of the Song dynasty desired to align themselves with China’s past rulers, and possession of antique artifacts implied equal stature with the wise rulers of ancient times. Ritual bronzes were amassed and catalogued, and records of these collections were published using woodblock-print illustrations. Ming and Qing rulers were decidedly more political in their artistic sensibilities, laying claim on the past as a form of legitimacy. This later form of archaism was more complex, as it drew sources not only from bronze vessels of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, but also from Song interpretations of earlier bronzes, ceramics, and jade, thus at times resulting in copies of more ancient copies. By and large, the shapes of Ming and Qing ceramics were based on earlier metal forms, yet their glaze techniques imitated those popular during the more recent Song dynasty.

These practices lost some of their importance with the breakdown of the Zhou government and ritual system. The subsequent social changes corresponded with the beginnings of the use of iron and other changes in technology, and resulted in an increase of wealth among a much broader segment of the population. These new patrons created a demand for luxury items in bronze, jade, lacquer, textile, and other materials. Items of personal adornment in bronze, which had been rare in earlier periods, were created in great numbers. Many were small in scale, elegant, and superbly crafted. Gilding, inlaying, and other decorative techniques also became more common and many items featured inlays of gold, silver, jade, and precious stones. All of these qualities are found in belt hooks, which were used to hang small objects or fasten elaborate belts around loose-fitting embroidered silk robes.

The inside of the tube is round; the outside has three corners, each at a 75-degree angle, evenly spaced. Each corner is decorated with a monster-mask design in a series of incised intaglio lines. The piece was catalogued as a jade of the Neolithic Liangzhu culture in 1994 (Asian Art Museum 1994, 128). Recent archaeological finds have disproved the idea—held for 1,000 years—that the cong tube was a ritual object originating in the Bronze Age. Neolithic Liangzhu graves in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have yielded various jade cong forms. The form with a deity's mask design was associated with the gods, and powerful people possessed these images to symbolize their exalted positions. The ruling class through the centuries used the cong during ceremonial worship of the universe. The cong, one of the well-documented six auspicious jades, has been copied through all periods in China's history. The most obvious sign that this piece is a reproduction is the artisan's use of new jade material not seen in the Liangzhu culture. Another sign is that the tool marks in the even line work on the masks were made by metal tools (Mou Yongkang, 1996). Before the Bronze Age, Liangzhu jade was worked with soft tools of leather or animal bone or with stone implements. In addition, the meander and triangle patterns on the mask are misinterpretations of Liangzhu mask designs.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/28163/preview,"H. 1 1/16 in x Diam. 2 7/8 in x D. 1/4 in, H. 2.7 cm x Diam. 7.3 cm x D. .64 cm",,,B81J1,China,,Liangzhu culture,,Cong tube with monster-mask designs

The two rectangular sections of the front face are decorated with the monster-mask design in shallow relief; the back is plain. The eyes and backgrounds of the mask sections differ from each other. The jade cutter inserted a central hole in the flat top cross section by drilling two small holes from opposite directions, forming a cow-nostril hole with a big opening and a smaller bottom. This piece was previously identified as a Neolithic Liangzhu jade (Asian Art Museum 1994, 128). Liangzhu plaque pendants were made mainly in three forms: a crownlike trapezoid, a semi-ellipse, and a semicircle (Zhejiang Institute of Archaeology 1989, 83–95, 119–28). Perforations were usually made in the two faces but not on the top cross-sections. The monster-mask design was the primary theme of Liangzhu jades. It was exemplified by extremely refined line work done with soft and hard tools (made of leather, plants, animal bones, or stones) and cylindrical drill heads (perhaps made of bamboo) working with sand. Under the microscope, the lines of Liangzhu pieces reveal unevenly chipped traces. This pendant has a number of errors commonly seen in recent copies. The material used was not available in the Zhejiang and Jiangsu regions at the time the piece was supposed to be made. The craftworker used a chemical treatment to produce an artificially eroded surface. The shape, a curved profile with three holes on the top cross section, was not known in the Liangzhu culture but is rather close to a Han model. Finally, the line work, poorly done in an attempt to imitate the Liangzhu working method, betrays its modern origin.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/14800/preview,"H. 1 5/8 in x W. 3/8 in x D. 2 3/8 in, H. 4.13 cm x W. 0.09 cm x D. 6 cm Diameter of middle hole at top 3/16 in",,,B60J623,China,,Liangzhu culture,,Pendant with monster masks

Both sides show the dragonet's profile, with a single horn, a short front paw close to a hole by the mouth, and a heavily carved bearlike rear leg. The triangular tail with the end coiled around a circular hole is an unusual characteristic. Both holes were drilled from only one side. Incisions alone are used to depict simple features. Along with other pieces, this plaque was said to have been completed in the late Shang or early Zhou period (d'Argencé 1972, 26, plate 6). Stylistically, it is very close to late Shang plaques in the shape of dragons or tigers. The arched back contour, the economical use of lines, and the positions of the two holes are all typical of pieces excavated from late Shang sites in Henan (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 2, plate 67).

Only the top surface of the cover is decorated. In four identical segments, it displays a centered dragon's head, with its sinuous body extending to the sides. At the inner and outer rims are raised circles. This classical design is not seen in ancient jades. The execution—with shallow relief and depressions for the dragon body—is certainly traditional, but this style was not seen in the design on ancient boxes. The surface was penetrated with a chemical treatment to add colors and flaws. Inspired by the repoussé technique of goldsmiths, Tang artisans made jade boxes to resemble metal ones. A jade box excavated from a Tang tomb in Xi'an mirrors the shape and decoration on gold and silver boxes of that era (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plate 35). The influence of metalwork persisted until the Song period, as illustrated by an oval box found in a Northern Song tomb in Hebei province. Its phoenix design in shallow relief is modeled on tenth-century metal originals (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 1, plate 105). Until the Ming period, jade boxes were still made in traditional forms (rectangular, square, or round boxes with covers). A piece with an inscription ""produced by Zigang,"" from the Palace Museum, Beijing (1995, vol. 41, plate 219), is a square with a shallow cover attributed to the famous jade cutter Lu Zigang of the Ming period.

Many of these designs consist of composite or wholly imaginary animals. On bronze vessels of the Shang dynasty, the most frequently seen of these animals is the taotie, a composite dragon-like animal whose body has been split down the middle and splayed out on both sides of the head. The head of the taotie has large eyes, horns, and a gaping mouth; the body at times has only one pair of legs. As the gong illustrates, in later periods of the Shang dynasty the taotie was joined by a wide range of dragons, birds, and other animals, both real and imaginary. What meaning did the taotie have? Some scholars believe that it evolved from decorative patterns and had no real meanings. Others argue that a motif as prominent as the taotie must have been central to the culture’s world view.

The material is different in quality from hetian jade and is closer to that from Xiuyan, in the Liaoning province. It has a slight waist near the top and a tapering lower section divided into five joints, each with leaf shapes on its four corners. One perforation, drilled from two sides, is seen on the upper part of the middle joint. The point is missing. Handle-shaped jades had a short life—from the beginning of the Bronze Age to the middle Western Zhou—and have been unearthed mostly from Henan (Zgmsqj 1986, vol. 9, plates 14, 15, 25, 108). These early handles either had no decoration or had from two to seven vertical floral panels. Only one excavated handle was decorated with eye patterns. There is some disagreement about their use. One theory holds that they were used during divination ceremonies to splash wine from a container, which was thought to facilitate communication with the gods (Hayashi 1991, 8–23); archaeologists, on the other hand, commonly describe them as symbols of military power. This piece is incorrectly proportioned—it is shorter and more sharply tapering than most Shang handles. The hole is drilled from both sides, tapers slightly toward the center, and shows evenly parallel marks. The grooves surrounding the panel ridges look freshly worked—the surface is whitish and clean, and the abrasive lines are very fine.

The plaque pendant has two faces decorated with a tall horn flaring on the top, crouching body, and a short, vigorous tail. A cone-shaped cavity decorates both the mouth and the point of the tail; the former one, to make up for one which failed in drilling, was re-ground. The chen character-shaped eyes in this case have no pupils. The major work is conveyed by single lines in intaglio; only one wide groove was crafted on the back of the neck. The dragon image in jade had already appeared in the neolithic Hongshan culture of the northeast. Pottery from the Erlitou phase corresponding to the Xia period were engraved with dragon images. Unquestionably, dragons became the prominent motif in Shang art. More frequently seen in extant collections, dragon pendants have been reported only a few times from late Shang sites at Anyang. 1 Those examples reveal a curved or crouching body, eyes with or without pupils, and one or two holes on the mouth and the tail. Nine jade dragon slit discs carved with superb skill were uncovered from the Fuhao tomb of King Wuding's wife, indicating that the dragon was associated with the highborn. Simple jade dragons are small and adorned with only single lines in intaglio, while those of good quality jade are decorated with double-outlined work, extravagant openwork, and beautiful burnishing. 1.

Particular flowers or combinations of birds and flowers were often chosen less for their intrinsic beauty than for their symbolic meaning. As a result, Ming and Qing artisans became successful in blending decorative motifs from multiple sources into a consistent, cohesive visual language. This language— utilizing birds, flowers, plants, and landscapes together with color symbolism—continued to evolve and expand during the Qing dynasty, reaching a pinnacle in the 1700s. Technological developments made possible the large variety of sizes, shapes, and decorative techniques of the objects in this case.

The robe is intricately patterned with sacred symbols woven by supplementary threads in multiple colors. The tailoring, choice of motifs, and layout are worked in a manner consistent with the style of semiformal garments of the nobility. Eight dragon medallions account for the Eight Auspicious Treasures of Buddhism, and the attributes of the Eight Immortals of Daoism. This world is said to float above an isle in the Eastern Ocean, set along the robe’s hem. The symbols suggested that dynastic reign would last forever. Dragon robes like one this were part of the court uniform worn by emperors and members of the nobility, who were considered legitimate wearers of the supreme dragon with five claws. This symbol of the Son of Heaven was not intended for merchants, but eventually the symbol lessened in value in the nineteenth century, as the court gradually lost central control.

These women wore a thigh-length jacket over trousers or over a full-length skirt like this one for both formal and informal occasions. The jacket and the skirt were usually made of the same material and sometimes were embroidered with matching designs. Because the jacket covered the upper part of the skirt, that area was often made of durable cotton, and the ornamentation was concentrated in the lower part, as seen here. This yellow silk fabric is woven with patterns of auspicious symbols among flowers. The central panels and the trims were embroidered with motifs of butterflies amid flowers, a traditional design associated with harmonious unions, such as happy marriages and joyful family reunions.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/2583/preview,"H. 38 1/2 in x W. 38 in, H. 97.7 cm x W. 96.5 cm",,,1995.56,China,,,,Woman's pleated skirt

Representing purity and independence, the flower grows out of muddy ponds and floats peacefully above the waters. Made up of layers of hide dyed in gradient tones, this red lotus was once used in a shadow puppet play, a popular form of entertainment in traditional China. With its loose petals arranged one over another and connected via a wire, the flower can turn into a full blossom in the air by controlling the long metal stick at its bottom. In Buddhism, the red lotus is often associated with the bodhisattva of infinite compassion and mercy (Avalokiteshvara), who hears the suffering of the world and saves devotees from troubles and sicknesses. Especially during the global pandemic, the lotus imagery of strength, resilience, and hope remains even more poignant, which is why it was chosen for the signage relating to the Asian Art Museum’s reopening. Rising above all that is happening now—amidst the health, political, economic, and environmental challenges—the lotus is born from muddy circumstances but stays unstained and lives elegantly.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/62261/preview,"H. 6 in, H. 15.2 cm",,,B62D48.35,China,,,,Shadow puppet of a red lotus

Among many early uses, the most often mentioned is as a stimulant by people practicing meditation, in both Daoist and Buddhist contexts. By the Tang dynasty (618–907) tea had become a national obsession. The Classic of Tea (Chajing) by Lu Yu (d. 804) expressed a strong preference for green-glazed tea wares to compliment the reddish-brown color of the tea. Most early teas were dark in color, roasted, and made from tea leaves pressed into circular bricks. Preparation involved grinding tea, boiling water, and tossing tea into the water or pouring the hot water into tea bowls. By the tenth century, use of whipped powdered tea came into vogue. Light in color, this tea involved nine stages in manufacturing, seven in brewing. At upper social levels, drinking tea was often accompanied by writing poetry, painting, and the enjoyment of beautiful objects.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/17354/preview,"H. 5 1/2 in x W. 6 3/4 in x D. 5 3/4 in, H. 14.0 cm x W. 17.1 cm x D. 14.6 cm",,,B60P1370,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",,,,Covered ewer with flower-petal finial

Particular flowers or combinations of birds and flowers were often chosen less for their intrinsic beauty than for their symbolic meaning. As a result, Ming and Qing artisans became successful in blending decorative motifs from multiple sources into a consistent, cohesive visual language. This language— utilizing birds, flowers, plants, and landscapes together with color symbolism—continued to evolve and expand during the Qing dynasty, reaching a pinnacle in the 1700s. Technological developments made possible the large variety of sizes, shapes, and decorative techniques of the objects in this case.

Several color combinations—with pigments applied either in underglaze or in colorful overglaze enamels—flourished through the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Multicolor, or “five colors” (wucai), decoration is a term applied to the combination of blue underglaze with three or more overglaze colors. The colors are applied in equal proportions; thus, no single color dominates and a balanced decoration is achieved. During the Ming dynasty, artists developed an unprecedented decorative scheme in which two or more colors were used in combination; this is sometimes called “three colors” (sancai) decoration. Pieces using this technique were produced during the reign of the Kangxi emperor (1662–1722) and are distinctive for their absence of red and their predominance of cooler colors: lavender, light yellow, and/or light green. One hallmark of Ming ceramics is the development of a stable, subtle marigold yellow. Two popular multicolor combination for yellow wares—red over yellow, and green over yellow—were developed during this time, the former employing a red overglaze on a yellow ground, and the latter a green enamel painted directly on a yellow ground.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/17443/preview,H. 2 3/4 in x Diam. 5 7/8 in,,,B60P1445,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",,,,Bowl with design of boys playing in a courtyard

The use of iron first became widespread during this period, and this, combined with advances in agriculture, allowed for a degree of prosperity at many levels of society. Reflecting the richness of the period, a variety of stylistic trends developed in bronze vessels. Definite regional styles coexisted with popular styles across regions; the highest-quality vessels, some of which were very large or had elaborately inlaid surfaces, were produced alongside simple and crudely cast vessels.

The influence of scholarly taste had its effect on virtually all aspects of artistic production, most obviously painting and calligraphy. Advances in the print industry allowed broad access to reproductions of pictorial imagery, which became pervasive in mediums such as ceramics, textiles, and lacquer. The popularity of landscape paintings and scenes from everyday life extended into all mediums. Especially popular at this time were how-to manuals that detailed the techniques of painting—methods for depicting the lines of garments and for types of dots and strokes in landscape elements.

The interior was hollowed through a circular opening in the center of the base, and, after the sculpting was finished, the original opening was sealed. Cylindrical, with a domed top, the piece portrays a traditional theme: a dragon in the ocean. The creature's head appears in a front view, with fully extended hair, while its body twists from its left side, around the rear of the piece, and then to the right, where its tail is coiled. Whirling among clouds, the dragon is flying over rocks and waves below. Production of three-dimensional jade ornaments for display increased in the Song period when literary art flourished. Openwork was used on jade for pictorial scenes, following the techniques used on wood, bamboo, and ivory. One archaeological find from Xi'an that was attributed to the Song period portrayed a mountain landscape in a three-dimensional oval jade sculpture with openwork (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plate 128). Several other mountain sculptures with openwork scenes were attributed to Song times (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plates 130, 154). A Yuan piece with dragon and phoenix illustrate the technique of crafting openwork from the outer surface and retaining the core of the piece (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 1, plate 167). High-relief ornaments with hollow interiors like this piece emerged in the Ming and continued in the Qing period.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/13745/preview,"H. 6 1/4 in x W. 3 7/8 in x D. 3 1/2 in, H. 15.9 cm x W. 9.9 cm x D. 8.9 cm",,,B60J63,China,,,,Dragon ornament

images/asian_chinese4699.jpg,The Avery Brundage Collection,,Nephrite,,,,Not on view,Chinese Art,,,,Jade And Stones,,,Western Han period (206 BCE-9 CE),"This green colored disc is divided into two zones of decoration by a striated border. The inner zone is decorated with a regular pattern of slightly raised, incised spirals. One can clearly see the grid used to set out these spirals within hexagonal units. This carving is a move away from the precision of the grain pattern; it is a more abbreviated design. The outer zone consists of four animal masks and a pattern of scrolls. These zoomorphic masks face outwards and have rounded horns, big eyes, prominent eyebrows, and small areas of hatched lines above the heads. Moving out and away from the head is a rhythmic scrolling of intertwined bodies or manes created by deep and shallow cuts. This mask decor may have developed from openwork pendants adorned with central animal faces of the Eastern Zhou (Rawson 249-250, fig. 5). The artist appropriated this design and reduced it to incised and beveled lines which capture and reflect the light. The same carved pattern appears on the back of the disk. This type of Bi disk was first developed in the Eastern Zhou but was used widely in burials during the Western Han. It was believed that placing these discs on the body would protect them from evil spirits and ghosts. The permanence and endurance of the material was thought to confer to the deceased immortality, successfulness, and security in the afterlife. As with the bi discussed above (#58), the two sides of this piece are exactly parallel and very uniform. However, it is cut from dark green Khotan jade, a color that had not been employed with any regularity from at least the early Western Zhou. This, along with the size, suggests a new source for jade during the late Warring States and Western Han. This green stone is not as translucent as the lighter yellow material, is less consistent in color, and has greater numbers of inclusions. The surface on this piece has some mottling from burial and some areas of alteration along the edge. 1. Rawson, 15:4 2. Yang, no. 202 3. Ayers, plate 95 4. Lam, no. 100 5.

The two holes were made differently. The upper one was drilled from two sides, leaving most of the center solid with a raised nipple; the one below was drilled from one side only. The entire piece is highly polished. Rectangular jades from the Longshan culture in the east and the west have been called blades (ben or yue) by archaeologists. Rectangular jades with two holes, found in early Shang tombs of the Bronze Age in Henan, have been identified as gui tablets (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 2, plates 4–5). Holes in those gui were reportedly drilled from two sides; this drilling technique was not found in Western Zhou gui found in Shaanxi (Liu 1996, [page nos.?], plates 81, 92, 93, 102, 128). Jade gui, associated with ceremonies and symbolizing nobility, persisted throughout China's history. This piece uses a new material to imitate a Shang style.

One of the most common uses was as incense burners. The bottom of an appropriately shaped vessel was filled with sand on which the incense was placed. Lids with elaborate openings to channel and shape the smoke were often added. Incense did not come into common use in China until the late Warring States Period and early Han dynasty; therefore this use had nothing to do with the original function of earlier vessels. Incense burners became immensely popular and were one of the most common forms of functional archaistic vessels in jade. The basic form for this example in gray jade does not have a Bronze Age prototype. Rather it seems to refer to vessels created during the Song dynasty. The same may be said of the decor; the body is plain except for cloud scroll patterns on the shoulders of the base and the elaborate dragon on the lid.

It alludes to King Wen of the Zhou dynasty, who had a hundred sons (ninety-nine natural sons and an adopted one). Portrayed in a garden with fantastic rocks, the boys are playing different games and conducting various activities, many of which carry auspicious symbols and implications, including the dragon dance (front) and lion dance (back). Other boys frolic in the lotus pond, a tableau that represents a wish for sons and grandsons to live in harmony. Another boy carries a large pomegranate bursting with seeds, symbolic of a wish for many male descendants. Among the trees is a tall osmanthus, from which a boy is taking branches. This act symbolizes the passing of the civil service examination with high honors ( tongzi zhegui ).

These practices lost some of their importance with the breakdown of the Zhou government and ritual system. The subsequent social changes corresponded with the beginnings of the use of iron and other changes in technology, and resulted in an increase of wealth among a much broader segment of the population. These new patrons created a demand for luxury items in bronze, jade, lacquer, textile, and other materials. Items of personal adornment in bronze, which had been rare in earlier periods, were created in great numbers. Many were small in scale, elegant, and superbly crafted. Gilding, inlaying, and other decorative techniques also became more common and many items featured inlays of gold, silver, jade, and precious stones. All of these qualities are found in belt hooks, which were used to hang small objects or fasten elaborate belts around loose-fitting embroidered silk robes. From the objects in this case you will see that bronze, iron, and jade served as bases for these belt hooks.

images/asian_chinese4735.jpg,The Avery Brundage Collection,,Nephrite,,,,Not on view,Chinese Art,,,,Jade And Stones,,,,"The majority of jades from the late Spring and Autumn period and early Warring States period are some form of personal adornment. Many are parts of the elaborate pendants which were the fashion of the time, while others were hairpins (#40), and, at a slightly later date, elements of belthooks. During the Warring States period, other types of ornaments became more common; chief among them were fittings for weapons, in particular swords and their scabbards (see #s 52-57 ). In a relatively few examples jade was apparently used for funerary shrouds. It is difficult to place this small ornament in any of these categories. The tang coming from the breast of the bird was obviously meant to be slotted into a larger object. However, it is designed in such a fashion that the bird would have been perpendicular to the object, rendering it impractical for a sword or other utilitarian object. It is perhaps one of the increasing number of decorative pieces that appeared in the later Warring States and on into the Han dynasty. The bird is a motif commonly associated with the south, in particular the states of Wu, Yue, and Chu during this period. Its appearance in jades is evidence of both the increasing influence of the arts of these states on those of the cultures around them and the fact that these states were major consumers of jades themselves. This piece is irregularly cut from very light colored Khotan jade. The stone is grey to white in color, very translucent, and appears to have numerous small black inclusions. The surface has been altered by burial and has areas that have been stained white and brown. The surface of the stone is very irregular with multiple curves and recessions.

Many of these designs consist of composite or wholly imaginary animals. On bronze vessels of the Shang dynasty, the most frequently seen of these animals is the taotie, a composite dragon-like animal whose body has been split down the middle and splayed out on both sides of the head. The head of the taotie has large eyes, horns, and a gaping mouth; the body at times has only one pair of legs. As the gong illustrates, in later periods of the Shang dynasty the taotie was joined by a wide range of dragons, birds, and other animals, both real and imaginary. What meaning did the taotie have? Some scholars believe that it evolved from decorative patterns and had no real meanings. Others argue that a motif as prominent as the taotie must have been central to the culture’s world view.

Several color combinations—with pigments applied either in underglaze or in colorful overglaze enamels—flourished through the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Multicolor, or “five colors” (wucai), decoration is a term applied to the combination of blue underglaze with three or more overglaze colors. The colors are applied in equal proportions; thus, no single color dominates and a balanced decoration is achieved. During the Ming dynasty, artists developed an unprecedented decorative scheme in which two or more colors were used in combination; this is sometimes called “three colors” (sancai) decoration. Pieces using this technique were produced during the reign of the Kangxi emperor (1662–1722) and are distinctive for their absence of red and their predominance of cooler colors: lavender, light yellow, and/or light green. One hallmark of Ming ceramics is the development of a stable, subtle marigold yellow. Two popular multicolor combination for yellow wares—red over yellow, and green over yellow—were developed during this time, the former employing a red overglaze on a yellow ground, and the latter a green enamel painted directly on a yellow ground.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/16270/preview,"H. 17 1/4 in x Diam. 8 1/2 in, H. 43.8 cm x Diam. 21.6 cm",,,B60P56,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",,,,Vase with mouth in the shape of a garlic bulb

With the rise of new philosophical developments, emperors of the Song dynasty desired to align themselves with China’s past rulers, and possession of antique artifacts implied equal stature with the wise rulers of ancient times. Ritual bronzes were amassed and catalogued, and records of these collections were published using woodblock-print illustrations. Ming and Qing rulers were decidedly more political in their artistic sensibilities, laying claim on the past as a form of legitimacy. This later form of archaism was more complex, as it drew sources not only from bronze vessels of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, but also from Song interpretations of earlier bronzes, ceramics, and jade, thus at times resulting in copies of more ancient copies. By and large, the shapes of Ming and Qing ceramics were based on earlier metal forms, yet their glaze techniques imitated those popular during the more recent Song dynasty.

These implements distinguished scholars from commoners in social and political position. Thus, early scholars’ objects were sometimes placed in tombs to ensure success in the afterlife.

The round cover and base in white hetian jade have an incised meander frieze on the side edge, and the top of the lid bears six floral panels in shallow relief. The cylinder, decorated with shallow-relief openwork, depicts the life of seclusion led by sages in the mountains. The cylindrical censer was an innovation of carvers of the Jiading school in the Zhejiang and Jiangsu regions during the late Ming period. A unique incense cylinder crafted from bamboo by Zhu Yazhen, one of the three Jiading masters, was found in a Wanli-period tomb (1573–1620) excavated near Shanghai (An 1980, 91–92). The top and bottom were covered with circular lids, whilethe openwork on the sides allowed the smoke to escape. The form was prevalent among bamboo and wood pieces in the Ming period and later appeared in jade pieces. Jade cylindrical censers in the Qing imperial collection were made of white or dark-green jade and were densely decorated with dragons in clouds, scenes from the lives of sages and farmers, people fishing in a landscape, or immortals in the mountains (Na 1986a, 45, fig. 2; Palace Museum, Beijing 1995, vol. 42, plates 36–38).

The approach to representing flowers during the Song dynasty was one of studied elegance. Emphasis was upon naturalistic shapes and precise, realistic depiction of scenes found in nature. Bird-and-flower themes were often featured in hand-sculpted and incised decoration, with careful attention paid to subtle colors and uniformity of design. Certain birds were always paired with certain flowers as they occur in nature. Encouraged by the contemporary vogue for keeping flowers in pots, artisans also created ceramic flowerpots. These works underscore the importance in Song ceramics not only of scenic representations but also of objects for practical use.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/17421/preview,"H. 1 7/8 in x Diam. 7 1/4 in, H. 4.8 cm x Diam. 18.4 cm",,,B60P1429,"Yaozhou, Shaanxi province, China",,,,Shallow bowl with design of peony blooms

Among many early uses, the most often mentioned is as a stimulant by people practicing meditation, in both Daoist and Buddhist contexts. By the Tang dynasty (618–907) tea had become a national obsession. The Classic of Tea (Chajing) by Lu Yu (d. 804) expressed a strong preference for green-glazed tea wares to compliment the reddish-brown color of the tea. Most early teas were dark in color, roasted, and made from tea leaves pressed into circular bricks. Preparation involved grinding tea, boiling water, and tossing tea into the water or pouring the hot water into tea bowls. By the tenth century, use of whipped powdered tea came into vogue. Light in color, this tea involved nine stages in manufacturing, seven in brewing.

The influence of scholarly taste had its effect on virtually all aspects of artistic production, most obviously painting and calligraphy. Advances in the print industry allowed broad access to reproductions of pictorial imagery, which became pervasive in mediums such as ceramics, textiles, and lacquer. The popularity of landscape paintings and scenes from everyday life extended into all mediums. Especially popular at this time were how-to manuals that detailed the techniques of painting—methods for depicting the lines of garments and for types of dots and strokes in landscape elements. The use of such manuals by artists and artisans working in many mediums resulted in highly conventionalized brushwork and other formulaic styles.

The tail curves gracefully between the rear legs. Incisions are used sparingly to suggest anatomical details. The unique design of this horse significantly changed the style of jade horses, which are usually portrayed standing or reclining on all four legs. Beginning in the Zhou period, metalwork and jade art depicted northern horses as short and strong. A small horse standing upright, found in a tomb from the Warring States Period (481–221 bce) in Shandong, is typical of the classical mode (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 3, plate 147). Paintings during the Song (960–1279) and Yuan (1272–1368) periods, which portrayed herds of thousands of horses in wild fields or at the feet of mountains, attempted to show the animals' precise movements, viewed from a horizontal perspective at torso level.

The influence of scholarly taste had its effect on virtually all aspects of artistic production, most obviously painting and calligraphy. Advances in the print industry allowed broad access to reproductions of pictorial imagery, which became pervasive in mediums such as ceramics, textiles, and lacquer. The popularity of landscape paintings and scenes from everyday life extended into all mediums. Especially popular at this time were how-to manuals that detailed the techniques of painting—methods for depicting the lines of garments and for types of dots and strokes in landscape elements. The use of such manuals by artists and artisans working in many mediums resulted in highly conventionalized brushwork and other formulaic styles.

During this era, China was divided into a number of regional powers. It was also a time of great philosophical, social, and technological change. The use of iron first became widespread during this period, and this, combined with advances in agriculture, allowed for a degree of prosperity at many levels of society. Reflecting the richness of the period, a variety of stylistic trends developed in bronze vessels. Definite regional styles coexisted with popular styles across regions; the highest-quality vessels, some of which were very large or had elaborately inlaid surfaces, were produced alongside simple and crudely cast vessels.

Among many early uses, the most often mentioned is as a stimulant by people practicing meditation, in both Daoist and Buddhist contexts. By the Tang dynasty (618–907) tea had become a national obsession. The Classic of Tea (Chajing) by Lu Yu (d. 804) expressed a strong preference for green-glazed tea wares to compliment the reddish-brown color of the tea. Most early teas were dark in color, roasted, and made from tea leaves pressed into circular bricks. Preparation involved grinding tea, boiling water, and tossing tea into the water or pouring the hot water into tea bowls. By the tenth century, use of whipped powdered tea came into vogue. Light in color, this tea involved nine stages in manufacturing, seven in brewing.

The approach to representing flowers during the Song dynasty was one of studied elegance. Emphasis was upon naturalistic shapes and precise, realistic depiction of scenes found in nature. Bird-and-flower themes were often featured in hand-sculpted and incised decoration, with careful attention paid to subtle colors and uniformity of design. Certain birds were always paired with certain flowers as they occur in nature. Encouraged by the contemporary vogue for keeping flowers in pots, artisans also created ceramic flowerpots.

This technique, known as “mercury gilding,” involved an application of a paste-like mixture of gold and mercury on bronze to create a gilded surface, which also gave the metal greater resistance to tarnishing. The bronze was heated by charcoal fire to evaporate the mercury, leaving the gold bonded to its surface. This gold surface layer was then burnished with a hard, smooth metal or stone tool to make it more compact and shiny. The use of gold on bronze in China dates back more than two thousand years, and this high-cost technique was traditionally used for luxurious decorations and icons. Many bronze-cast buddha and bodhisattva statues were adorned with this gilding technique to attract more devotees. Small, lustrous figures and icons like these in the cases were carried for spiritual protection on journeys and placed on household altars for worship. It is important to note that many altar shrines were made in segments and then assembled, and so over the centuries some have lost attachments or have had parts from similar-sized works reattached.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/55247/preview,H. 9 1/2 in x W. 4 1/2 in x D. 3 5/8 in,,,B60B1057.a-.b,China,,,,Buddha

Reflecting the richness of the period, a variety of stylistic trends developed in bronze vessels.

The humblest of these objects served a utilitarian purpose: candlesticks to provide light, and water droppers and brush washers to aid in the process of writing or painting. These implements distinguished scholars from commoners in social and political position. Thus, early scholars’ objects were sometimes placed in tombs to ensure success in the afterlife.

The coat is elaborately decorated with eight embroidered medallions depicting dramatized scenes from the famous novel Dream of the Red Chamber by Cao Xueqin (1719–1764). It tells of a young boy named Jia Baoyu, who dreamed of marrying his beloved cousin Lin Daiyu, and was instead promised by his family to marry a different girl of compatible social status. Unaware, Baoyu went happily to the wedding hall, but seeing that the bride was not his sweetheart, Baoyu despaired, while Daiyu later died isolated and brokenhearted. The story has been adapted in the fine arts and in countless stage and film productions. On this robe, a fine example of embroidery, the two medallions on the lower rear depict a highlight of the story, known as “burying fallen flowers,” a hint at the traumatic life of Daiyu. In this scene, she holds a basket carrying the fallen petals she swept up out of pity, off in search of a spot to bury them, while nearby is the naïve Baoyu who wants to share a letter with her. Dream of the Red Chamber makes its debut in Western opera in a San Francisco Opera production in the fall of 2016.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/11322/preview,"H. 45 3/4 in x W. 51 in, H. 116.20 cm x W. 129.54 cm",,,2014.2,China,,,,Woman's informal coat with scenes from Dream of the Red Chamber

The craftworker left gray flaws and infusions around the muzzle of the animal and dyed conspicuous areas brown. Two hollowed sections inside the muzzle and behind the neck help to create a skillfully realized sculpture. Subtle nuances, for example in the bone structure of the joints on the horn and the spine set the work apart from most other beasts carved at the time. Refined parallel lines gracefully trace the leaf-shaped hair on the back and the tail. The upright position of the tongue in the hollow muzzle and the charmingly crooked front claws give the sculpture a lively, humorous quality. Underneath, the unicorn's four paws are carved in relief with the toes shown by deep cuts. During the reign of the Qianlong emperor (1736–1795), the image of a mythic beast with head turning backward was said to have originated with Han bronze paperweights (Liang Shizheng [1700–1800] 1965, vol. 6, chap. 38, p. 36). Images of unicorns (or their equivalent) had appeared much earlier, however—in the Bronze Age. This posture was often portrayed on small flat plaques in Eastern Zhou jade work (770–221 bce) (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 3, plates 79, 150). For many dynasties, three-dimensional jade animals were designed with the head facing straight forward, perhaps because a turned head was difficult to carve in high relief. Two examples—a reclining beast in the Palace Museum, Beijing, attributed to the Tang period, and a standing winged unicorn unearthed from a Yuan tomb—are both presented with the head facing forward (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plates 160, 169). It was left to Ming and Qing jade cutters to overcome the technical challenges of carving more complex and interesting postures.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/22347/preview,"H. 2 3/8 in x W. 1 1/2 in x L. 3 in, H. 6 cm x W. 3.8 cm x L. 7.6 cm",,,B65J10,China,,,,Unicorn

The long muscular body is tensed on four bent legs, evoking suppressed strength. In an unusual view from the front, the horse strains its head to touch its hind leg, creating the only open space in the piece. The artisan paid greater attention to the form than to other details. The mane is embellished with long striated locks extending down the back of the neck, and the tail is rendered similarly. Traditional horse paintings from the Song and Yuan periods were treasured by emperors, and the exotic breeds of horses sent in tribute from Central Asia to the Qing court were frequently reproduced in court art. Famous paintings by the Italian court artist Castiglione (1616–1670) depicted horses from all angles (front, back, side, and places in between) and in varied positions (coiled to spring, recumbent, bending over, crawling, and facing upward) (National Palace Museum, Taipei 1994, vol. 14, plates 35–37).

Tapering to a narrower top, it has a rough surface with dirt-filled pockmarks. One face shows four meanders in shallow relief; the other side displays a sinuous dragonet with a coiling tail. A central hole penetrates the flat top, with two smaller holes beveled from opposite directions. In an illustration from the 1400s this form was called a beng; in the 1800s it was called a bi (Wang [approx. 1120–1127] 1752, chap. 8, p. 5; Teng 1992a, 135). The term beng is inaccurate for the chape; a study of sword fittings shows that this term should be used to refer to the sword guard. The term biao referred to the point of a bronze sword in Han writings and was borrowed for jade chapes, which appeared to substitute for guards and cover the metal end. The term bi in the first dictionary, Shuowen Jiezi (Xu [approx. 1–100 ce] 1970), was defined as the lower section of a king's sword. Archeologists still do not agree about which name is correct for the chape. During the Warring States Period, a whole set of four fittings was rarely found on a single sword; swords were usually fitted with only a pommel and a guard (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 4, plates 17, 71, 72, 81, 82, 84, 104, 106, 123, 124). The complete set on one sword was popularized in the Han period. Excavated Han jade chapes are composed of a trapezoid chunk. The central part is thick, gradually thinning toward the sides, and the flat, elliptical top contains one or three holes for fitting the chape onto the end of a scabbard. The two faces are covered with designs. Cloud, grain, and meander motifs were still the main themes. When dragonets or phoenixes and dragons appeared, they were set against a secondary cloud design (Kaogu 1962, 12:623; Nanjing Museum 1974, 118). This is a typical example of a piece whose surface was subjected to a process of chemical eroding and chipping.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/27465/preview,"H. 1 1/4 in x W. 1 7/16 in x D. 1/2 in, H. 3.17 cm x W. 3.65 cm x D. 0.63 cm",,,B73J2,China,,,,Sword chape (bi or biao)

The dragon's head on the hook was rendered with refined raised lines and incisions. On the face, two dragonets (young dragons), each carrying a branch of fungus in its mouth, appear in openwork relief. One dragonet is supported at eight points: one at the whiskers, four at the legs, one at the tail, and two at the fungi. The other dragonet has only seven: it lacks one fungus support point. The dragonets are arranged symmetrically, and their features are consistent. The design, especially the openwork, appears to have been executed with a manual spinning wheel. Jade belt sets with hook and buckle developed from the single metal hook of early times. Exactly when they emerged remains uncertain. A Han jade buckle found in Henan had a rectangular plaque with a crescent opening; judging by several small holes around its edge, the buckle was probably sewed onto leather or fabric (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 3, plate 194). Belts on official uniforms of the Tang period were made of leather and decorated with gold to which jade plaques were attached. Several jade sets, some with leather or gold accessories and others without any attachments, came to light in aristocrats' tombs in the Tang capital Xi'an. Among them one jade set consisting of fifteen plaques and one oval belt buckle exemplified a distinctive change: the hook, like the ancient style fashioned in the Central Plains area, had disappeared (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plate 5). By the Song period, leather belts were being covered with red or black textiles so that ornaments could be attached more easily. Yuan and Ming belts followed the Song style, covering belts with red or blue textiles and affixing ornaments of rhinoceros horn, jade, gold, and silver. The two ends of the belt were often joined by a flat jade plaque on a jade ring or slit, or one end was passed through a ring-shaped jade frame with a tongue. During the Qing period, belts for officials were made completely of textiles and were fastened by a jade plaque in the center with a jade ring on each side. The hook shape seen in this set was no longer used. Jade hook-and-buckle sets continued to be manufactured until the present, however, to preserve archaic styles.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/29052/preview,"H. 7/8 in x W. 4 1/4 in x D. 1 1/2 in, H. 2.2 cm x W. 10.8 cm x D. 3.8 cm",,,B86J10.a-.b,China,,,,Belt set (hook and buckle)

The design on one side is composed of variations of raised C patterns. The other side is rendered with lines of raised bosses. The inner and outer edges on both sides have a narrow raised border.The entire design suggests a typical Han style. The raised boss is the basic feature in four related motifs on jades from the Warring States Period through the Han dynasty: a C shape consisting of two bosses connected by an incised line; an S shape with an incised line; a comma with an incised tail; and an unembellished nipple. The first two are generally associated with clouds in the immortal paradise. The third is called either the cloud or the ""curled silkworm"" design. The last is traditionally defined as the ""nipple boss"" or the ""grain decor,"" which appeared on early bronzes. The grain design was most often used on Han jades, as evidenced by pieces from tombs in Hebei (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 4, plates 207, 241). The craftwork of this piece is far below the skill level of the Han period. The nipple bosses are formed in irregular sizes on a roughly worked background and are not arranged in straight columns. The rims of the raised border edges are uneven and not properly beveled.

These practices lost some of their importance with the breakdown of the Zhou government and ritual system. The subsequent social changes corresponded with the beginnings of the use of iron and other changes in technology, and resulted in an increase of wealth among a much broader segment of the population. These new patrons created a demand for luxury items in bronze, jade, lacquer, textile, and other materials. Items of personal adornment in bronze, which had been rare in earlier periods, were created in great numbers. Many were small in scale, elegant, and superbly crafted. Gilding, inlaying, and other decorative techniques also became more common and many items featured inlays of gold, silver, jade, and precious stones. All of these qualities are found in belt hooks, which were used to hang small objects or fasten elaborate belts around loose-fitting embroidered silk robes. From the objects in this case you will see that bronze, iron, and jade served as bases for these belt hooks.

Archery contests were a feature of court life and are often depicted in pictorial arts of the period. Thus it is not surprising to find archery paraphernalia in the finest materials such as jade. Thumb rings ( jue ), like this example, were used to protect the thumb during the draw and release of the bow string. During the Han dynasty, the ring became the basis for a form of a purely ornamental jade pendant. Also called jue , these pendants far outnumber functional pieces . However, the piece under discussion here is quite functional and is an indication of the continued importance of ceremonial archery during this period. The functional nature of this example is quite clear with the overall shape designed to fit onto the lower part of the thumb and the small projection serving to capture and hold the bow string. In contrast to the increasingly ornate jue -shaped pendants, it has no surface decoration. This ring is cut from low quality Khotan jade. The color ranges from tan to dark brown, with many cloudy areas. There is almost no translucence, and the polish is matte. This might be explained by the fact that this is a functional piece rather than a piece of personal adornment and, therefore, different criteria were used in judging the material.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/14725/preview,H. 1 3/4 in x W. 1 in x D. 3/8 in,,,B60J577,China,,,,Archer's ring (jue)

These designs appear on a background of openwork swastikas. The five bats (see B60 J95) symbolize the Five Blessings of longevity, wealth, health, love of virtue, and a peaceful death. The shou medallion is a symbol of longevity. This motif, known as wufu pengshou, or five blessings surrounding longevity, is a popular one, and was a favorite design for the decorative art of the Qing dynasty.

images/asian_chinese5135.jpg,The Avery Brundage Collection,,Nephrite,,,,Not on view,Chinese Art,,,,Jade And Stones,,,Western Zhou period (approx. 1050-771 BCE),"Flat or silhouette shapes of deer are among the most common of Western Zhou jade pendants. Some examples have a small amount of additional surface work indicating parts of the animal's body while others are totally flat. Most are depicted as mature males with extensive antlers. However, a few examples are shown as does, or perhaps fawns, with large ears and no horns. This piece and another in the collection of the Seattle Art Museum are examples of the latter. Almost invariably the deer are depicted with their heads laid back over their shoulder, a mannerism which provides a certain animation to these otherwise very simple pieces. The dating of these pieces are supported by finds from the Western Zhou sites at Fengxi and Gaoji in Shaanxi province. The workmanship on this piece is cursory. The sides of the slab from which it was cut are not parallel; they thin from top to bottom and in some areas are curved. Since these curves have no relation to the body or decor, it must be assumed they are unintentional and are a sign of either technical shortcomings or a lack of attention to such details. The only surface decoration is the eyes and mouth of the deer; they consist of little more than quick slashes. The piece was suspended from the hole cut to form the neck and jaw line of the deer. This area was created by creating two holes with a drill, connecting them with a string saw, and then cutting out the rest of the details. No attempt has been made to hide or finish the signs of the tools. This overall lack of finish may suggest that such pieces were meant for burial. The piece is cut from greenish tan Khotan jade which has dark clouded areas near the rear hip of the deer.

The features are summarily treated. A line in low relief, reaching from the head down to the caudal fins, defines the body. The round eyes are defined by a number of unpolished cuts made by a metal disc. Short barbels hang below its mouth, and a single hole has been drilled above the left barbel so that the piece can be strung with a silk cord. This piece is crudely rendered but powerful. In later jade pieces, craftworkers made a point of polishing to obliterate the marks left by the various drills and wheels; this unpolished piece gives us a good idea of how certain features, such as the eyes, were cut. The catfish, nianyu, is a pun for abundance year after year.

Among many early uses, the most often mentioned is as a stimulant by people practicing meditation, in both Daoist and Buddhist contexts. By the Tang dynasty (618–907) tea had become a national obsession. The Classic of Tea (Chajing) by Lu Yu (d. 804) expressed a strong preference for green-glazed tea wares to compliment the reddish-brown color of the tea. Most early teas were dark in color, roasted, and made from tea leaves pressed into circular bricks. Preparation involved grinding tea, boiling water, and tossing tea into the water or pouring the hot water into tea bowls. By the tenth century, use of whipped powdered tea came into vogue. Light in color, this tea involved nine stages in manufacturing, seven in brewing.

Particular flowers or combinations of birds and flowers were often chosen less for their intrinsic beauty than for their symbolic meaning. As a result, Ming and Qing artisans became successful in blending decorative motifs from multiple sources into a consistent, cohesive visual language. This language— utilizing birds, flowers, plants, and landscapes together with color symbolism—continued to evolve and expand during the Qing dynasty, reaching a pinnacle in the 1700s. Technological developments made possible the large variety of sizes, shapes, and decorative techniques of the objects in this case.

The main figure near the top is the Queen Mother, who sits on a throne supported by a dragon and a tiger. Farther down the tree is a seated Buddha, right underneath the portal to heaven guarded by two celestial figures. Early Buddha images are found in some objects associated with the Queen Mother, perhaps because Buddhism was a religion of the west, the direction in which she resided. A number of winged immortals (xian), the residents of the Queen Mother’s paradise, can also be seen on this tree.

This Buddhist temple was originally built in the early sixth century. It was destroyed during the anti-Buddhist persecution of 576, but was reestablished during the Sui dynasty (581–618) to promote belief in Maitreya, the buddha of the future. More than 3,775 square and diamond-shaped tiles were assembled to decorate the facade of the stupa with Buddhist icons and Indian motifs, with some tiles bearing braided-cord patterns that clearly allude to textiles. The stupa today has the appearance of a Central Asian tent that was propped up by four poles and embellished with exotic textiles. Here, the lion represents the ride of Bodhisattva Manjusri and the six-tusked elephant represents the ride of Bodhisattva Samantabhadra.

These represent the earth and the four directions. Above these peaks are dragons among colored clouds, which represent the sky. There are nine dragons, a number reserved for the imperial house. The dragon is the emblem of the masculine (yang) element and hence of the noblemen. The central front dragon with five-clawed legs encircles a flaming orb known as the Pearl of Wisdom.

A dragon is worked on both faces, primarily in double parallel lines of intaglio. The beast has a single horn, a single paw, and a curled tail. The perforation on the nose was drilled from one side; two others, in the open mouth and at the other end, were drilled from two sides. The semicircular form and the close double parallel lines across the body were used particularly for Shang dragon pendants. Excavated pendants found in Zhou tombs mostly depicted dragons realistically, in profile on both faces of the pendant, with the head and tail at opposite ends. They all demonstrate a consistent style—the dragon's mouth was executed as a slit perforated by a round opening with serrated edges; the tail was indicated by a round hole; an additional hole for suspending the pendant was located anywhere along the dragon's notched back ( Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 2, plates 100–101, 103). This new piece was cleverly worked so that colored areas accent the dark head and strips of the body.

Rectangular, rather than square, in section, this vessel was ideal for cutting in jade. This example is made from a mottled gray jade of the type known as Han jade during the reign of the Qianlong emperor because of its antique appearance. Some of the coloration might have been enhanced by dyeing. The shape is based on Ming dynasty archaistic vessels, while the decoration is definitely later.

Later these items were produced in smaller sizes so that these screens could be set on a desk, table, or cabinet in the studio. By the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644– 1911) dynasties, a jade table screen, often with decoration on both sides and resting on a wooden stand, had come to represent the height of fashion among China's educated elite. 清朝碧綠玉梅絏累放扌亭圖檉方屏 During the 1700s and 1800s dark green jades with varying intensities of color were readily available from sources in northwest China. The dark colors of this material were well suited for objects used in ritual, ceremonial, or commemorative functions, such as vessels, table screens, and jade books. The front of this dark green screen shows a landscape in relief. Enclosed by corridors and protected by overhanging trees, mountain villages extend along winding streams. Plum blossoms are scattered in conspicuous spots among bamboos and pines. Intricate rocky cliffs appear at the center, above which a crane flies through rolling clouds. The lyrical depiction recalls the style of classical painting of the 1200s–1400s.

These practices lost some of their importance with the breakdown of the Zhou government and ritual system. The subsequent social changes corresponded with the beginnings of the use of iron and other changes in technology, and resulted in an increase of wealth among a much broader segment of the population. These new patrons created a demand for luxury items in bronze, jade, lacquer, textile, and other materials. Items of personal adornment in bronze, which had been rare in earlier periods, were created in great numbers. Many were small in scale, elegant, and superbly crafted. Gilding, inlaying, and other decorative techniques also became more common and many items featured inlays of gold, silver, jade, and precious stones. All of these qualities are found in belt hooks, which were used to hang small objects or fasten elaborate belts around loose-fitting embroidered silk robes.

A fascinating study of changes in fashion and ideals of feminine beauty can be made by examining these tomb models. The human figurines in these tombs were arranged in a definite hierarchy. Models of servants and support staff were arranged along the floors and niches.

Its single horn and tail are each beautifully divided into two curling sprouts in relief, a reminder of traditional dragons. Bulging roundels on all sides indicate eyebrows, horn, eyes, and spine. The hollows between the chest and the two front paws and between the curling bifurcated tail and the rump are eye-catching when viewed from the underside. Deeply engraved lines delineate the four paws. This piece was documented in 1972 as originating in the medieval period, but that dating deserves to be reconsidered.

Usually Shang pan have three irregularly shaped perforations where the bowl and feet meet. Late Zhou texts refer to pan as vessels used for ablutions, and the aquatic nature of their main ornamental schemes clearly indicates that they were meant to hold water. These unusual designs and the special cursive way in which they are rendered illustrate a surprising freshness of attitude, a sort of popular vein which is usually absent from all other categories of vessels. The exterior decoration of this vessel (back, B60B37) consists also of two bands. The upper band is divided into six panels, each one with an elongated eye motif in flat relief against a meander background. The foot band is more simply made of large, but dense, spirals and raised lines. The distribution and association of the motifs incised inside the bowl echo those we have just described in connection with the other pan .

A three-graph inscription is incised high on the wall between the beak of a fish and the tail of a dragon. The first graph represents a broom in a house, the second a kneeling figure with his head turned all the way round and the third a foot print.

In use during the Shang period and possibly the beginning of the Early Western Zhou, this shape seems to mark one of the first conscious departures' on the part of bronze casters from ceramic traditions. Basically fangyi are square or rectangular covered boxes, set not on feet, but on a base aligned with the body. This base has four semicircular openings located in the middle of each side, and the bottom of the container is on a level with the upper part of the base. Covers are usually roof-shaped, more rarely dome-shaped. Sizes and proportions can vary, but generally speaking, both shape and ornament remain remarkably consistent. With very few exceptions, elaborate fangyi bear an overall decoration extending from the tip of the knob on the cover to the lower rim of the base, and in most cases the main motifs consist of eight taotie masks, four on the body and four on the lid, the latter placed upside-down. Dragons of various kinds are frequent secondary motifs, and the contours of the vessels are underlined by strips or full-fledged flanges which contribute to the rather austere aspect of this very format shape. The technique used in the decoration of our first fangyi (left. B60B644) is unusual in that the horns and ears of the eight taotie masks have very sharp raised outlines and de pressed centers. Together with the bulging eyes, these elements are the only ones to stand in fairly high relief. The balance of the masks, including peculiarly pointed chins, as well as other motifs, are incised. This applies to inverted animal masks and concentric triangles respectively on the large and small sides of the roof-shaped knob of the lid and to ""dragonized"" eye motifs on both the neck and the base, each of these bands containing eight such motifs. The sharp flanges have I and L-shaped scores.

This vessel is in fact a bottle-shaped hu equipped with a ""keyhole"" handle. The overall decoration consists mainly of animal motifs in flat relief and with incised details against a background of fine spirals. The knob of the lid is in the shape of a small bird with a powerful beak and with scale motifs on its breast. The dome or the lid presents three concentric zones of decoration, a couple of parallel lines in the center, surrounded by a belt with I and T-shaped scores and an outside meander band. The upper neck band contains four birds with spiraling tails and beaks, as well as unusual wattles. The lower neck band consists simply of a row of meanders. On the upper shoulder zone four taloned dragons are confronted, two by two, to form on either side of central ridges two large taotie masks. Atypically, the open mouths and teeth are clearly indicated. The narrow lower shoulder belt is made or barbed, interlocked S-shaped spirals. Basically the motifs of the main zone on the belly of the vase are similar to those of the upper shoulder band; here, however, the masks have neither mouths nor teeth, their horns are curling down instead of up and small descending dragons are located under the tails or the dragons. The main axis or the foot band is marked by two ridges serving as apexes for two shields of highly conventionalized taotie masks on either side of which is a regardant gaping dragon. The profile of the conspicuous handle is emphasized by a flange with T-and-L-shaped scores. On both sides of this flange, incised zigzag lines delineate dotted triangles. The terminal animal heads have bottle-shaped horns and mouths that echo that or the mask on the upper shoulder band. This handle is attached to the lid by means of a peculiar device which consists or two links, a hybrid animal partly (cicada partly bat) and a coiled dragon which swallows its tail and whose body is scaled.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/12703/preview,"H. 14 3/4 in x W. 6 3/4 in, H. 37.5 cm x W. 17.2 cm",,,B60B1008,China,,,,Ritual wine vessel (you)

May his hundred sons and thousand grandsons forever use and treasure (it).""",Metal Arts,,,Western Zhou period (approx. 1050-771 BCE),"The ""leather straps and rivets""' on the lower part of the hu (B60B1012) serve as a frame for eight identical panels filled with symmetrical, barbed C-shaped figures centering on a single protuberant eye. This is the culmination of the development of a motif which can be traced back to the Early Western Zhou. The small revolving animal shapes reproduced eight times on the upper neck belt and four times on the shoulder are derived from such dragons as decorate the Mid Western Zhou yi . The grooved foot and rising blades of the intermediary zone on the neck also have antecedents. In the final analysis the originality of the vessel rests with its crown, lid and handles. The crown, an openwork rendering of the broken wave band with conventionalized masks, serves as a pen for the buffalo-shaped knob of the small flat lid. The sturdy and tense loop handles bear animal heads of a well-known type, but these heads are equipped with flat raised trunks in the shape of fanged and flanged dragons which look peculiarly aggressive. This hu bears three inscriptions incised on the lid, the base of the crown and the neck.

A small bell is attached at the center point of the underside of the base. The vessel’s handles are in the form of horned animals with curling tails.

The designs on the bowl consist of two pairs of plumed animals, often identified as dragons, facing away from each other.

By the Tang dynasty (618–907) tea had become a national obsession. The Classic of Tea (Chajing) by Lu Yu (d. 804) expressed a strong preference for green-glazed tea wares to compliment the reddish-brown color of the tea. Most early teas were dark in color, roasted, and made from tea leaves pressed into circular bricks. Preparation involved grinding tea, boiling water, and tossing tea into the water or pouring the hot water into tea bowls. By the tenth century, use of whipped powdered tea came into vogue.

Of particular note are certain ceramic wares used specifically for sculpture: Dehua, Zhangzhou, Shiwan, and Yixing wares, all named for and characteristic of the places in which they were made. Dehua wares, known in the West since the 1700s as blanc de Chine (“China white”), were produced in Dehua, in southeastern China’s Fujian province. Technical improvements achieved in the 1500s for obtaining and purifying the milk-white glaze and ivory-white clay made possible the sculpting of large figures in porcelain. Zhangzhou wares—those attributed to the Zhangzhou kiln, also in Fujian province—are distinctive for their crackled ivory-colored glaze. The Shiwan kilns at Foshan, Guangdong province in southern China produced wares with thick bodies and colorful glazes, especially known in the West as flambé (suffused) glazes. Sculptural figures and architectural ceramics are particularly significant in Shiwan ware. Clay found at Yixing, Jiangsu province in southeastern China was used to create ceramics in a characteristic range of dark colors—from brown, purple, and green to buff and beige. Yixing ceramics are known to enhance the color, fragrance, and taste of tea; therefore, the majority of Yixing ware is in the form of tea sets.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/16174/preview,"H. 16 3/8 in x W. 6 3/8 in x D. 6 1/8 in, H. 41.6 cm x W. 16.2 cm x D. 15.6 cm",,,B60P20+,"Dehua, Fujian province, China",,,,Poet Qu Yuan (339–279 BCE)

Wine was served warm, and many wine vessels had relatively long legs so they could be placed over a fire. Spouts were also required for pouring the wine into cups.

The head is bent gracefully, and the tail feathers sweep upward and forward, curving above the crest. The circles around the eyes are deeply incised, in the same manner as those on the bird finial (B60 J344). The wings display three types of feathers, simply incised. The legs, in high relief, are shown on the vertical side of the body beneath the tail. The phoenix is a mythical bird that would only alight on the wutong (Firmiana simplex) tree. Paired with the dragon, the phoenix symbolized the emperor and empress. In ancient China the phoenix was part of the decoration on the empress's headdress. Later on, it was used by women in general. This type of phoenix with upswept tail feathers is traditionally dated to the Tang dynasty or earlier (d'Argencé, 1972, [page no.?], plate 31; see also Watt, [year?], [page no.?], plate 76; Fung and Yeung, [year?],100; Forsyth and McElney, [year], [page no.?], plate 174).

Many of these designs consist of composite or wholly imaginary animals. On bronze vessels of the Shang dynasty, the most frequently seen of these animals is the taotie, a composite dragon-like animal whose body has been split down the middle and splayed out on both sides of the head. The head of the taotie has large eyes, horns, and a gaping mouth; the body at times has only one pair of legs. As the gong illustrates, in later periods of the Shang dynasty the taotie was joined by a wide range of dragons, birds, and other animals, both real and imaginary. What meaning did the taotie have? Some scholars believe that it evolved from decorative patterns and had no real meanings. Others argue that a motif as prominent as the taotie must have been central to the culture’s world view.

Among many early uses, the most often mentioned is as a stimulant by people practicing meditation, in both Daoist and Buddhist contexts. By the Tang dynasty (618–907) tea had become a national obsession. The Classic of Tea (Chajing) by Lu Yu (d. 804) expressed a strong preference for green-glazed tea wares to compliment the reddish-brown color of the tea. Most early teas were dark in color, roasted, and made from tea leaves pressed into circular bricks. Preparation involved grinding tea, boiling water, and tossing tea into the water or pouring the hot water into tea bowls. By the tenth century, use of whipped powdered tea came into vogue. Light in color, this tea involved nine stages in manufacturing, seven in brewing.

The use of iron first became widespread during this period, and this, combined with advances in agriculture, allowed for a degree of prosperity at many levels of society. Reflecting the richness of the period, a variety of stylistic trends developed in bronze vessels.

It contains early material from the Pali Canon, arguably the most ancient stratum of Buddhist literature. In addition, it contains texts from the Great Vehicle or Mahayana, especially the Perfection of Wisdom, whose ideas define the dominant philosophical perspective in Tibet. Finally, it contains texts called tantra that describe the visual and philosophical meditations of the Vajrayana, or Lightning Vehicle. Whenever they may have come to light historically, however, practitioners understand all of these texts as composed by the Buddha himself, but held back until the right circumstances presented themselves. In addition to texts understood as the Buddha’s direct teachings, called the Kanju, there is an equally immense body of commentarial literature called the Tenjur. Although different recensions differ somewhat in size, depending on texts included and mode of typography, they comprise, by some estimates, 332 volumes. Tibetan writing was invented specifically to help standardize the translation of the Indian language of Sanskrit into Tibetan. The process took place in two waves, the first by the Ancient or Nyingma order, and the second by the New or Sarma orders. Tibetan Buddhist texts are written on stacks of leaves turned forward from front to back as the text is recited. As befits their sacred character, they are usually protected by wooden covers. These covers, whose incised decoration can be quite ornate, often bear inscriptions that tell us the text they were intended to contain. During the Cultural Revolution, estimates suggest that approximately six thousand monasteries and their extensive libraries were destroyed. Some, however, survive in museums and private collections.

This image of Amitayus is a good example of a jade sculpture based on a bronze prototype. The piece depicts the Buddha of endless life, a form of Amitabha. He appears as a youthful deity wearing elaborate jewels, and sits in the full lotus position on his throne. His hands are in the gesture of meditation. A small hole drilled into the palm attests to the fact that his hands once held a vase of ambrosia, which grants immortality. During the Qianlong period, the emperor had literally thousands of Amitayus images cast in bronze for his mother's birthdays. On her seventieth birthday in 1761, the Qianlong emperor gave her 9,999 images of Amitayus to wish her long life. The Asian Art Museum has one example of an Amitayus made in 1770, possibly for the empress dowager's eightieth birthday. These Amitayus images were made in the Nepalese style: youthful figures with locks of hair going down their upper arms, floral earrings, and a necklace with three leaf-like pendants beneath the central medallion. Except for the missing crown and jeweled armlets, this image is a close copy of the bronze prototype, which has long locks of hair going down the arms, floral earrings, and the typical Nepalese necklace. The eyes, resembling an elongated ""M,"" are also based on the bronze Amitayus statues. The ambrosia vase is lost, as is the crown, which was made separately.

Like many designs of the early Ming dynasty, precedents for the floral décor are to be found in works created at the Southern Song court. Song examples are most often paintings or ceramics; it was in the early Ming that these designs were fully explored in carved lacquer. In the base of this piece is incised a six-character mark reading Da Ming Yongle nian zhi, indicating it was created at the lacquer workshops during the reign of the Yongle emperor. Court records tell us that the Yongle emperor summoned well-known lacquer workers from Jiangnan to the imperial palace workshops, that these workers were granted official titles, and that an official workshop known as the Guoyuan chang (Orchard Workshop) was established. However, as noted in the introductory essay to this section, there is some question about the actual function of the Guoyuan chang in the early years of the dynasty. In order to make possible the deeply carved designs in lacquers like this box, the object first had to be covered with a large number of thin layers of lacquer— in a piece like this perhaps as many as one hundred layers. Each layer had to cure thoroughly and be lightly polished before the next layer could be applied. In order to cure properly, lacquer must be kept in a stable environment with consistently warm temperatures (21– 27°C) and high humidity (75 – 85 percent). Creating a piece with a hundred layers could require as much as a year or more of this consistent environment. Climatological studies indicate that Beijing was cold and dry during much of the Ming dynasty, and it is highly unlikely that any building in that city could have maintained the required environment for lacquer to cure. The same studies show that the Jiangnan area along the lower reaches of the Yangzi River, where the lacquer workshops of the Song and Yuan dynasties were located, was humid and temperate. It seems likely that the workshops of the early Ming, where the elaborately carved lacquers were created, remained in the Jiangnan region. The Guoyuan chang might have served as a warehouse for storing these lacquers once they were shipped to Beijing. It is also possible that the elaborate blanks were created in the Jiangnan area and shipped to Beijing where the designs were carved.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/73451/preview,"Overall: H, 3 1/4 in × W. 9 1/4 in × D. 9 3/8 in (8.3 cm × 23.5 cm × 23.8 cm)",,,B60M309.a-.b,China,,,,Lidded box with carved flower designs

Some are admired for their songs; others, such as pigeons, are trained to carry messages. During the Han dynasty, people seventy years of age were given a staff with a bird finial. The bird, usually a dove, was believed to be able to swallow and digest food without choking. The gift therefore conveyed a wish that the recipient would do likewise.

These practices lost some of their importance with the breakdown of the Zhou government and ritual system. The subsequent social changes corresponded with the beginnings of the use of iron and other changes in technology, and resulted in an increase of wealth among a much broader segment of the population. These new patrons created a demand for luxury items in bronze, jade, lacquer, textile, and other materials. Items of personal adornment in bronze, which had been rare in earlier periods, were created in great numbers. Many were small in scale, elegant, and superbly crafted. Gilding, inlaying, and other decorative techniques also became more common and many items featured inlays of gold, silver, jade, and precious stones. All of these qualities are found in belt hooks, which were used to hang small objects or fasten elaborate belts around loose-fitting embroidered silk robes. From the objects in this case you will see that bronze, iron, and jade served as bases for these belt hooks.

On each corner are sets of three friezes, consisting of two sections decorated with horizontal lines and one section decorated with two eyes, repeated vertically. This cong was modeled after a Liangzhu cong style. Jade cong forms from the Liangzhu culture consist of one to thirteen vertical friezes in a repeating design. A monster-mask face on Liangzhu jades (seen in Cong tube with monster-mask designs , B81 J1) was often simplified on cong with multiple sections. In the simplified design a series of horizontal lines represented a mouth, nose, and eyebrows above round eyes, as shown here. The obvious flaw in this copy is in the choice of hetian material from Xinjiang, far to the northwest of the Liangzhu culture. Liangzhu jade materials were acquired predominantly from nearby sources. There is no archaeological evidence suggesting that Xinjiang jade reached the area during the Neolithic period. In addition, the spaces between lines and the use of wide and narrow horizontal lines above the eyes are not characteristic of the Liangzhu style, which generally used much more even, dense, fine, unbroken lines. The tool marks on the eyes show that the circles were not worked by drilling with a circular drillhead, as are all eyes on Liangzhu cong but instead were engraved little by little with a sharp tool.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/15220/preview,H. 4 1/4 in x W. 1 1/2 in x D. 1 1/2 in H. 10.8 cm x W. 3.8 cm x D. 3.8 cm,,,B60J874,China,,,,Cong vase

Two perforations close to the edges were drilled from only one side; they bear traces of chipping around the circle on one face after drilling. Thin, curved jade pendants in beast forms have been unearthed mainly from Shang and Zhou tombs. Such pendants were characterized by simple designs in the Shang and the Western Zhou periods and were ornamented with detailed features during the Eastern Zhou.

Particular flowers or combinations of birds and flowers were often chosen less for their intrinsic beauty than for their symbolic meaning. As a result, Ming and Qing artisans became successful in blending decorative motifs from multiple sources into a consistent, cohesive visual language. This language— utilizing birds, flowers, plants, and landscapes together with color symbolism—continued to evolve and expand during the Qing dynasty, reaching a pinnacle in the 1700s. Technological developments made possible the large variety of sizes, shapes, and decorative techniques of the objects in this case.

Valued for its decorative and symbolic scheme, the imaginative depiction is associated with a traditional wish-making ceremony with images of historical and mythical figures. Through the auspicious presentation the host believed he would be blessed by Daoist deities and immortals and thus obtain longevity and great fortune. The elder couple in the central pavilion is General Guo Ziyi (679–781) and his wife. Guo is renowned for reclaiming the capital of the Tang dynasty from invading tribal troops. Because of his loyalty and bravery, he became the prime minister and enjoyed tremendous wealth, fame, and good luck, as well as longevity and family prosperity. Guo family members and guests from the court accompany the couple in this celebration. Other attendees include Daoist immortals coming from heaven. On the left, from the top, are Liu Hai (carrying a string of coins), Zhang Xian (the child protector, with a bow), and the Monkey King (keeper of the heavenly peach garden). On the right are Dongfang Shuo, carrying a peach branch, along with two female musicians.

The symmetrical arrangement of the medallions of dragons and flowers on this garment indicates wealth and nobility. Woven into the fabric are flower designs—peony, magnolia, cockscomb, plum blossom, peach, chrysanthemum, osmanthus, and cymbidium (a type of orchid)—and butterflies. This combination is not associated with a specific season; rather, it is a year-round auspicious motif known as ""one-hundred flowers,"" designed to be worn on ceremonial occasions. Above the woven hem are dragons and symbols of Buddhism, including a wheel, canopy, umbrella, lotus, vase, fish, and knot. The sleeves are decorated with smaller medallions and a shorter wave motif, among which are swastikas (another auspicious symbol at the time), branches of coral, wish-granting wands, and scrolls.

Ancient ceramics, sometimes in near-pristine condition, have continued to appear in local Southeast Asian markets in recent years. Often these pieces were discovered by fishers, who pulled up objects when trawling the ocean floor. The ceramics in their nets came from some of the many shipwrecks that can still be found in the waterways where, centuries ago, huge ships carried cargoes of trade wares. In the past few decades, underwater archaeologists have been able to scientifically excavate several of these shipwrecks, providing us with invaluable information not only about the types of ceramics produced but also about larger patterns of maritime trade. Although China dominated the maritime ceramic trade for centuries, shipwrecks containing cargoes full of wares from Thailand and Vietnam indicate the growing competition from Southeast Asia for the export market.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/4056/preview,"H. 2 in x Diam. 6 in, H. 5.1 cm x Diam. 15.2 cm",,,2000.26,"Changsha, Hunan province, China",,,,Bowl with flowers

Ancient ceramics, sometimes in near-pristine condition, have continued to appear in local Southeast Asian markets in recent years. Often these pieces were discovered by fishers, who pulled up objects when trawling the ocean floor. The ceramics in their nets came from some of the many shipwrecks that can still be found in the waterways where, centuries ago, huge ships carried cargoes of trade wares. In the past few decades, underwater archaeologists have been able to scientifically excavate several of these shipwrecks, providing us with invaluable information not only about the types of ceramics produced but also about larger patterns of maritime trade. Although China dominated the maritime ceramic trade for centuries, shipwrecks containing cargoes full of wares from Thailand and Vietnam indicate the growing competition from Southeast Asia for the export market.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/4017/preview,"H. 2 3/4 in x Diam. 12 1/2 in, H. 7 cm x Diam. 31.7 cm",,,2000.11,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",,,,Plate with egrets and aquatic plants

Many court painters (broadly known as the Zhe school) created such storytelling pictures for the nobility, and some acclaimed paintings created for the court still survive today. These paintings served as visual reminders admonishing the powerful to associate with righteous scholars and to consult with wise officials in administering the state. Many elite patrons followed this trend and commissioned artists to imitate those works by court artists, as they appreciated pictures showing how ancient officials sought to be courteous to the wise and condescending to the virtuous. This painting is presented in a Zhe-school landscape style, where an official and his attendants stand outside a palace or a temple complex late at night, as if patiently waiting to meet an important figure inside.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/68186/preview,Image: H. 58 1/4 in × W. 29 1/4 in (148 cm × 74.3 cm) Overall: H. 96 5/8 in × W. 35 5/16 in (245.4 cm × 89.7 cm),,,2021.115,China,,,,Visiting a Palace at Night

Embroidered silk like this work commonly presents a scene in southern China through a configuration of raised threads. The compositional arrangement along with stitched lines and strokes was adapted from a woodblock-printed illustration. The color scheme showing primarily green and blue gives the scene a fresh, summer-like atmosphere. Many legendary places in southern China were exposed to the public on a large scale after Emperor Kangxi (r. 1662–1772) ordered depictions of his favorite spots from his travels to the south.

In contrast, the surrounding orchids, bamboo, and thorns are quickly rendered with light ink washes. The artist omitted a complicated setting of hills and streams to enhance clarity, and used subtle and elegant brush techniques to capture the idyllic scenery of lush southern China. A versatile artist of several genres, Xiang was associated with a group of artists from Huating (modern Shanghai), including Dong Qichang. The Huating artists employed conventional brushwork to build dense layers of hills in landscapes, but they also used new compositions as alternatives to traditional approaches. Grandson of a famous art collector, Xiang had access to the greatest collections in China, which allowed him to study and learn from celebrated early masters. Xiang inscribed his motivation for this lyrical composition: Forest scents abound after the rain. Birds enjoy clear ripples. Overlapped mountains emerge from the distance. The beauty appears on the hill.",https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/27293/preview,"H. 35 3/16 in x W. 13 in, H. 89.4 cm x W. 33 cm (image), H. 82 in x W. 19 in, H. 208.3 cm x W. 48.3 cm (overall)",,,B72D37,,,,,Fresh Forest after the Rain

This turtle plaque with a head, two damaged legs, and a tail out of the shell, becomes gradually thinner toward the tail. On the back of the body, two eyes, a wrinkled neck, and three whirls on the shell are indicated by shallow-relief and double lines in intaglio. On the bottom two cone-shaped cavities beneath the neck are drilled through toward each other. Despite of the inferior jade quality, the jade is simplified to a naive version. The turtle image is significant in Chinese culture as a sacred symbol. A neolithic jade turtle from the Hongshan culture in Liaoning province demonstrates the same plaque form with a perforation horizontally through the belly and was probably the prototype of later examples. 1 The artistic theme, carried on by Shang jade makers, was crafted with special features. Late Shang jade turtles found in Anyang, Henan province are important for two reasons. 2 One is that they provide the earliest known example in Chinese jade art in which the natural colors of the jade were intentionally exposed to correspond to different parts of the subject. Secondly, the form of two turtles connected into one have been found there. This piece, however, echoes the common type of late Shang turtles. 1.

Robust and elegant, shapes are almost classical in their rotundity, simplicity and directness. Perfectly adapted to these shapes, the ebullient decor, tempered by strict symmetry consists essentially of uninterrupted circular bands of more or less abstracted animal shapes in low relief and filled with granulated or thread-like details, the latter being usually variants of the round-and-triangular volute. Liyu style ding vary greatly in proportions and iconography. This series comprises some of the smallest and largest vessels ever produced by Chinese bronze casters. The surface decoration of the diminutive ding (B60B5+) consists of a circle on top of the cover and of four concentric bands of regardant and legless dragons. Starting from the top, the first and third bands utilize the same pattern of boldly, intertwined dragons with elongated lolling tongues and bifurcated tails. The dragons of the second and fourth bands have short tongues and form a continuous frieze in the sense that the tail or each dragon merges into the crest of the following one, without any obvious transition. The third and fourth bands are separated by a twisted rope in high relief. The circle on top of the cover is inscribed with a whorl pattern made of triangular and round volutes. The handles are also incised with geometric designs. The cabriole legs bear animal masks in high relief and the three bovines in the round that adorn the cover are reminiscent of those of the ding of Pl.
