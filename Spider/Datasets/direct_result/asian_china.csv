,,probably 1100-1050 BCE,,,,,On view,images_china/asian_china5.jpg,,"Surviving Rhinos Only two bronze rhinoceroses are known to have survived from ancient China. (Similar bronze animals are shown on the wall projection.) The fantasy of the sacred rhinoceros continued in China for more than two thousand years. Artisans continued to make rhino-formed ritual vessels. Many were crafted with features like those of a deer or horse, but were still recorded in historical documents as a “rhinoceros vessel” or simply a mythical creature. The rhino shown at right from the early Western Han period (approx. 206–200 BCE) is a rare example of a vessel crafted true to the animal’s features. 小臣艅尊 商晚期 青銅 1843年 山東壽張縣梁山出土 Ritual vessel in the shape of a rhinoceros Probably 1100–1050 BCE China; unearthed in Liangshan, Shandong province Shang dynasty (approx. 1600–1050 BCE) Bronze The Avery Brundage Collection, B60B1+ The only known surviving bronze rhinoceros from the Shang dynasty. 錯金銀雲紋犀尊 西漢 青銅 1963年陝西興平縣出土 Ritual vessel in the shape of a rhinoceros China Western (Former) Han period (206 BCE–9 CE) Bronze with inlays of gold and silver National Museum of China, Beijing A later bronze in the shape of a rhinoceros. Rhinoceroses in Ancient China Can you imagine what rhinoceroses that lived three thousand years ago looked like? The vessel on display in this gallery depicts a two-horned Sumatran rhino that existed in ancient China and can also be found in a wide area of Southeast Asia. The fact that rhinoceroses lived in ancient China was confirmed in 1949, based on scientific analyses of the rhinoceros bones excavated in central China in the city of Anyang, where an archaeological site has yielded remains dating to the Shang dynasty (approx. 1600–1050 BCE). Early Chinese texts carved on ox bones and turtle shells used in divination during the Shang dynasty, known as oracle bones, mention rhinoceros hunts. Evidently capturing rhinoceroses and sacrificing them during rituals was a significant state event during the Bronze Age (approx. 2000–500 BCE). To successfully complete the king’s commission of this bronze sculpture, the craftsmen may have been shown an actual rhinoceros for study.","27-graph inscription cast into the inside of the rhinoceros' belly (inscription indicates that the object was made for storing ""money"" (shells)",Shang dynasty (approx. 1600-1050 BCE),Metal Arts,"H. 9 in x W. 9 in x D. 14 1/2 in, H. 22.8 cm x W. 22.8 cm x D. 32.8",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60B1+,Bronze,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/49144/preview,Ritual vessel in the shape of a rhinoceros

Depicted on one side of the cup is a a large sailing boat on river waves with eight people pulling oars. The two scholars standing outside of a tall castle are probably Su Shi and an associate arriving in the ancient city of Huangzhou. The story ends on the opposite side with a depiction of a river bank with anchored boats. The openwork carving on the handle consists of trees and craggy mountains that continue inside the mouth. Rhinoceros horn (which is actually a dense accretion of hair) is well-suited for carving. The decoration on horn cups often shares themes with other functional arts, such as lacquer carving and ceramics. Very few rhinoceros horn cups were created during most of the 1400s and the first decades of the 1500s; this can be attributed to the rarity of the animal in China, along with restrictions on imports from other countries. These import restrictions were lifted in 1565, which corresponded with a period of economic prosperity throughout much of China. Demand for luxury items like cups made from rhino horn was high at this time. As a result, the period from 1565 through the early 1700s is considered the classical period for carved rhino horn cups. But demand for horn exceeded the supply, and the rhinoceros was driven to the point of extinction throughout much of East and Southeast Asia. The Rhinoceros in Chinese Culture Rhinoceros horn was thought by the Chinese to help cure certain diseases, neutralize poisons, and increase male virility.

It has also led to a strong market for antique rhino horn cups. In the past decade the high price paid at auction for rhino horn has increased by a factor of more than twenty.

,,338,,,,,On view,images_china/asian_china13.jpg,,"Buddha Dated 338 This statue is the earliest known dated Buddha sculpture produced in China, with an inscription on its base mentioning the year 338. This date is about four hundred years after Buddhism was introduced from India to China. Originally from an altar shrine, this Buddha statue was once seated on a platform and adorned with a canopy and two halos. It is among the largest bronze sculptures to have survived from the fourth century, when Chinese Buddha images were heavily influenced by the art of ancient Gandhara in modern Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India. Chinese characteristics make this statue an important milestone in the development of Buddhist art in China. The figure’s arrangement, with legs crossed beneath an evenly draped robe and set on a rectangular pedestal, is probably modeled after a Gandharan prototype brought to China via the Silk Road. However, this Buddha’s overlapping, inward-facing palms are adopted from a formal Chinese gesture of reverence. His face, hairstyle, robe, and throne have also been adapted according to Chinese preferences to attract native devotees. The social and political chaos and the invasions of nomadic peoples from the north contributed to the rapid spread of Buddhism among various ethnic groups who all sought spiritual relief and a better afterlife. The fragmentary inscription on the back of the base indicates this statue belonged to the Later Zhao kingdom (319–351), a kingdom founded in Hebei by a nomadic people who eventually controlled most of northern China. It was in this kingdom where Buddhism became a state-sponsored, widespread religion after being a minority religion for hundreds of years. This statue was commissioned by a monk who  was probably a foreign disciple of the famous Indian monk Fotudeng. Fotudeng arrived in the Central Plains in 310, preaching the Buddhist faith and seeking converts. He was trusted by Later Zhao rulers as a miraculous and venerated master and served as the principal religious counsel and military adviser in their campaigns to expand the territory. To worship Buddha for blessings of victory, these non-Han rulers commissioned the building of large-scale temples, the construction of ornamented grottoes, and the mass production of Buddhist statues. The partial inscription on the base reads: 建武四年, 歲在戊戌, 八月卅日, 比丘竺...

,,1982,,,,"Yang Yanping (Chinese, b. 1934)",Not on view,images_china/asian_china17.jpg,"""Yang""","This depiction of a mother nursing her infant is a contemporary scene that pays homage to the style of the Impressionists. The mother’s body is portrayed in a manner unlike a traditional Chinese female figure, with muscular arms and legs rendered with solid dark-gray colors. With a broad application of ink wash, Yang Yanping suggests a solidity and weight for the mother, who will be the protector of this child for years to come. In contrast to the heavy brushstrokes, Yang uses a series of refined dots and short dashes for the large woven fishnet the mother sits on, and delicate brushwork to indicate a seaside location. Touches of light purples and pink give the picture a feeling of femininity. This memorable depiction comes from Yang’s experience during her travels in southeastern China in 1982. Although Yang absorbed the influence of many Impressionist works and shared their enthusiasm for scenes of modern life, she also developed her own unique expression, exploring the use of nontraditional methods to create stylized yet realistic images.",,,Painting,"H. 66 in x W. 24 in, H. 167.6 cm x W. 61.0 cm (overall)",Gift of Shang-Qing Zeng,,2010.46,Ink and colors on paper,,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/62583/preview,Nursing an Infant on Fishnet

Xiao Shufang paints tulips in the summer of 1978. This painting, which at first glance appears to be a simple still life of tulips, is in fact a expression regarding major changes in China's artistic environment. How do we know this? Tulips are not native to China, which means the artist intentionally chose a foreign topic. This would have taken some courage in 1978, just two years after the end of the Cultural Revolution. This is one of a series of tulip paintings Xiao Shufang did to celebrate China's new openness to the West. Xiao Shufang was born in Zhongshan, Guangdong province, in southern China, and studied painting at the Beijing Art School and Nanjing Central University with such leading artists as Xu Beihong (1895-1953). Between 1937 and 1940 Xiao lived in England, where she studied watercolor and sculptureùand quite likely saw tulips. She returned to China and, as with many foreign-trained artists of her generation, faced many challenges, particularly during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).

,,1704,,,,,Not on view,images_china/asian_china33.jpg,,"Tibetan Buddhist Texts Tibetan Buddhism’s textual corpus is immense and encyclopedic. It contains early material from the Pali Canon, arguably the most ancient stratum of Buddhist literature. In addition, it contains texts from the Great Vehicle or Mahayana, especially the Perfection of Wisdom, whose ideas define the dominant philosophical perspective in Tibet. Finally, it contains texts called tantra that describe the visual and philosophical meditations of the Vajrayana, or Lightning Vehicle. Whenever they may have come to light historically, however, practitioners understand all of these texts as composed by the Buddha himself, but held back until the right circumstances presented themselves. In addition to texts understood as the Buddha’s direct teachings, called the Kanju, there is an equally immense body of commentarial literature called the Tenjur. Although different recensions differ somewhat in size, depending on texts included and mode of typography, they comprise, by some estimates, 332 volumes. Tibetan writing was invented specifically to help standardize the translation of the Indian language of Sanskrit into Tibetan. The process took place in two waves, the first by the Ancient or Nyingma order, and the second by the New or Sarma orders. Tibetan Buddhist texts are written on stacks of leaves turned forward from front to back as the text is recited. As befits their sacred character, they are usually protected by wooden covers. These covers, whose incised decoration can be quite ornate, often bear inscriptions that tell us the text they were intended to contain. During the Cultural Revolution, estimates suggest that approximately six thousand monasteries and their extensive libraries were destroyed. Some, however, survive in museums and private collections.

The Chinese term for jadeite, feicui, was originally the name of a bird from southwestern Asia mentioned in books of the Han period. The word was said to come from the names of two other birds—the fei with red feathers and the cui with green. Tang period documents note that it was a bird with both red and green feathers. Later authors borrowed the term to allude to beautiful colors on ornaments and jewelry. Around 1900, some scholars claimed that objects found in Zhou and Han sites were made of jadeite. Others said that China had not imported jadeite from Burma until the eighteenth century. Still others argued that Yun'nan and Henan provinces were sources of jadeite in China. A recent systematic study of gemstones by geologist Luan Bing'ao (1989, 97–106) concluded that jadeite was not native to China and entered China from Burma through Yun'nan during the Qing period.

It was painted by a student of Taiga, the master artist who did the twelve paintings pasted on the screens to your left. As is common among Japanese ""literati"" painters of the day, the painter of these screens had never been to China to see this scenery in person. Instead, he was inspired by copies of earlier Chinese paintings in Japan. Further information: This two-panel screen depicts Yueyang Pavilion, a site famous in China for its literary associations. The pavilion overlooks Lake Dongting, depicted here with distinctive repeating waves, beyond which lie mountains and the Yangzi River. Lake Dongting is China's second-largest freshwater lake and acts as a flood basin for the Yangtze River, causing the lake's appearance to change seasonally and occasionally even daily. A Song dynasty scholar named Fan Zhongyan once marveled at the way Lake Dongting enhanced the view from the tower, claiming the rippling water ""seems to expand boundlessly."" The artist Aoki Shukuya was a student of Ike Taiga (whose screens are shown to your right) and successor to his teacher's Taigado studio. He painted this work—a rare example by Shukuya in the screen format—in the last year of his life. Like most Japanese literati painters, this artist never saw Yueyang Pavilion in person.

,,approx. 1980-1990,,,,"Fang Zhaoling (Chinese, 1914 - 2006)",Not on view,images_china/asian_china79.jpg,,"Beginning in 1975, hundreds of thousands of people fearing political persecution fled Vietnam by boat. As conditions in Vietnam worsened, the number of refugees grew, ultimately reaching two million. Many braved the typhoons and traveled great distances, landing in neighboring countries in Southeast Asia. Hong Kong took in many of the floating refugees, but by 1989, more than a decade after the change of government in Vietnam, Hong Kong was encouraging many of them to return to their homeland, sparking debate over the plight of this population. At a time when the disposition of the ""boat people"" was being decided in Hong Kong, Fang Zhaoling made a series of paintings based on them. Writing the inscription from their point of view, Fang addresses their aimlessness and loss of direction, identifying with their ambiguous future perhaps because Hong Kong's citizens would soon be in a similar predicament owing to its imminent changeover in government. Born in China in 1914 Fang Zhaoling studied in Britain and the United States before settling in Hong Kong. She has studied painting under a variety of teachers: Qian Songyan, a traditionalist from Fang's native city of Wuxi; Chao Shaoan, a master of the Lingnan school; and Zhang Daqian, who sought the sources of his style in China's most ancient art. However, Fang Zhaoling developed an individual style whose distinctive features are spontaneity and an apparent naiveté. The inscription by the artist reads: Drifting along in the great big ocean, like a boat moving through the vast desert, at times getting lost, at times not knowing where I came from. I decide a direction for myself, since life matters most. The affairs of the world have changed enormously. Once I establish a direction for myself, I can avoid vacillating between two different paths. Signed Zhaoling.","Drifting along in the

Of particular note are certain ceramic wares used specifically for sculpture: Dehua, Zhangzhou, Shiwan, and Yixing wares, all named for and characteristic of the places in which they were made. Dehua wares, known in the West since the 1700s as blanc de Chine (“China white”), were produced in Dehua, in southeastern China’s Fujian province. Technical improvements achieved in the 1500s for obtaining and purifying the milk-white glaze and ivory-white clay made possible the sculpting of large figures in porcelain. Zhangzhou wares—those attributed to the Zhangzhou kiln, also in Fujian province—are distinctive for their crackled ivory-colored glaze. The Shiwan kilns at Foshan, Guangdong province in southern China produced wares with thick bodies and colorful glazes, especially known in the West as flambé (suffused) glazes. Sculptural figures and architectural ceramics are particularly significant in Shiwan ware. Clay found at Yixing, Jiangsu province in southeastern China was used to create ceramics in a characteristic range of dark colors—from brown, purple, and green to buff and beige. Yixing ceramics are known to enhance the color, fragrance, and taste of tea; therefore, the majority of Yixing ware is in the form of tea sets.",,,Ceramics,"H. 3 in x W. 2 3/4 in x L. 13 in, H. 7.62 cm x W. 6.98 cm x L. 33 cm",Gift of Rhoda Mesker,,2000.4.a-.b,Earthenware (Yixing ware),,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/3986/preview,Teapot in the shape of a bamboo boat

Here, a seated panda concentrates on eating the bamboo, using its paws, while three bamboo stalks and a root are close by behind him. Wu applied thick ink in broad washes to form the panda’s eyes, ears, and round structure, and lightly curving lines to sketch the contours of its body, using these contrasting tones to express the adorable playfulness of the living creature. A native of Suzhou, Wu studied art in Europe and later taught at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. The panda is one of Wu’s favorite subjects, and his characteristically rhythmic and softly accented ink washes owe much to Qi Baishi (1863–1957), who achieved considerable success as a painter of small animals. Wu’s subjects—pandas, buffalo, farmers, and children—embody the nature-loving spirit of many people in rural China. His sympathetic portrayal of lovely animals especially earned him huge popularity worldwide.

,,2005,,,,"Mi Guangjiang (Haji Noor Deen) (Chinese, b. 1963)",Not on view,images_china/asian_china127.jpg,,"Islam has a long history in China, and Chinese Muslims have played significant roles in a number of activities, particularly finance and trade. Perhaps the most famous Muslim in Chinese history is the great Ming dynasty admiral and explorer Zheng He, who led a Chinese fleet through Southeast Asia, around India, and along the east coast of Africa in the early 1400s. For centuries after, Chinese Muslims found that their knowledge of both Chinese and Arabic gave them an advantage along the vast trade routes where these two languages were widely used for business dealings. The artist of this work, Haji Noor Deen (Mi Guangjiang), is a Chinese Muslim who is trained in the art of Arabic calligraphy. His calligraphy works are an unusual combination of the Arabic and Chinese calligraphic traditions, highlighting issues of identity and diversity in China. The artist, as translated by Rashid Patch, provides this explanation of the calligraphy: The large Chinese character means ""peace."" The shape of the Chinese also forms the Arabic lettering as-salaam (""peace""), written vertically in highly stylized ""sini"" style Arabic script. So, the piece is a hybrid, reading ""peace"" simultaneously in Chinese and Arabic script. In the upper section of the calligraphy, the top panel is also in sini style Arabic letters (though very highly stylized) reading ""In the Name of God, Most Merciful, Most Compassionate."" The sini style of Arabic lettering was developed in China (sini means ""Chinese"" in Arabic), and although it has a thirteen-century-long history of development, it is not well known to Muslims outside of East Asia. It often employs a brush rather than the reed pen used in most Arabic calligraphy. The letter forms tend to vary in thickness far more than the other major Arabic script styles, and often have an almost liquid character. Sini script is frequently written (and read) vertically, like Chinese script, as well as in the usual Arabic right-to-left pattern. Forms and graphic motifs from traditional Chinese calligraphy and art are often incorporated into sini Arabic, enriching the script. The Arabic letters in this section form the shape of crossed spears in a weapons rack, a traditional display in martial arts schools and a common design motif in Chinese graphics. If the spear tips were pointed straight up, it would express wariness, potential hostility, trouble, or war. With the spear points crossed over each other, the image expresses peace, the end of hostilities, and security.",,,Painting,"H. 35 3/4 in x W. 20 3/4 in, H. 90.8 cm x W. 36.2 cm (image); H. 54 1/4 in x W. 20 3/4 in, H. 137.8 cm x W. 52.7 cm (overall)",Gift of Haji Noor Deen,,2005.94,Ink on paper,,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/6026/preview,Calligraphy

What is innovative about this composition? First, night scenes are relatively rare in Chinese painting as they require a reversal of the usual technique; most of the painting surface must be covered with rich bluish ink and the details of the scene painted in lighter colors or indicated by areas of untouched paper. Also, this is clearly an exotic scene; the towering bamboo and the architectural style indicate a location somewhere in far southern China. Zhang Bu is known for his dramatic use of color and for dynamic compositions. Born in Hebei province in 1934, Zhang studied painting at the Central Academy of Fine Art in Beijing with Li Keran. Li was trained in Europe and was among the artists active in China during his generation who attempted to combine elements of Western painting with those of traditional Chinese.

This technique, known as “mercury gilding,” involved an application of a paste-like mixture of gold and mercury on bronze to create a gilded surface, which also gave the metal greater resistance to tarnishing. The bronze was heated by charcoal fire to evaporate the mercury, leaving the gold bonded to its surface. This gold surface layer was then burnished with a hard, smooth metal or stone tool to make it more compact and shiny. The use of gold on bronze in China dates back more than two thousand years, and this high-cost technique was traditionally used for luxurious decorations and icons. Many bronze-cast buddha and bodhisattva statues were adorned with this gilding technique to attract more devotees. Small, lustrous figures and icons like these in the cases were carried for spiritual protection on journeys and placed on household altars for worship. It is important to note that many altar shrines were made in segments and then assembled, and so over the centuries some have lost attachments or have had parts from similar-sized works reattached.",,Yuan (1261-1368) or Ming dynasty (1368-1644),Sculpture,"H. 13 3/8 in x W. 8 in x D. 5 in, H. 34 cm x W. 20.3 cm x D. 12.7 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60S566,Bronze with gilding,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/73313/preview,Seated bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (Guanyin)

There is substantial evidence for the importance of Islamic art at his court. The success of Zheng He's exploration (see cat. no. 65) further encouraged the emperor's hopes of a rapprochement with other parts of the world. Foreign envoys who returned with Zheng He, bearing various tributes, particularly amazed the Yongle emperor. To better fulfill China's diplomatic missions, as well as to reap the benefits of trade, myriad Chinese products were prepared for Zheng He's fleets. The most valuable good that China could produce in mass quantities during this era was porcelain. A 1988 excavation by archaeologists found ruin strata of early Ming-dynasty official kilns in Jingdezhen. Remains of large porcelain plates, bowls, and jars discovered in the Yongle-period stratum are now known to have been created as exports for Islamic markets. Never in the history of Chinese ceramic manufacture had as many foreigninspired forms taken shape as in the Yongle emperor's factories. Certain forms among these were even adopted for use in the imperial palaces and temples. One statistic suggests that nine out of twenty-one whiteglazed ceremonial types have forms originatingin Islamic metalwork (Urban Council et al. 1989, pp. 22 – 23, pl. 1, 4 – 6, 8 – 9, 11, 13, 22).

Gongchuo remarks that he had seen more than ten works by Wang Duo, none of which were as carefully composed as this one. Wang's dedication to Jesuit missionary Johann Adam Schall von Bell (1591–1666, known in China as Tang Daowei or Tang Ruowang) increased its desirability. The last section, which is in seal script (zhuanshu), also appealed to Gongchuo since examples of this script by Wang Duo were exceptionally rare. Gongchuo celebrates the purchase with two inscriptions: ""This poetry handscroll, is now in my hand""and ""Inscribed for acquiring this piece in the first month of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic [1936], Gongchuo."" This piece assembles three unrelated compositions by Wang Duo. The first is an important example of communication between a member of the educated elite of China in the 1600s and a Jesuit missionary. It consists of a long poem written in cursive script (caoshu) and dedicated to von Bell. Wang records his responses to von Bell's tales and descriptions of the Western world, which were told over many meetings between the two men. Following this long poem are two series of poems written in clerical script (lishu). These are filled with the sadness Wang felt as he witnessed the turmoil that led to the fall of the Ming dynasty","Section 1

This work of tight composition and dark colors suggests a bold experiment of self-expression; Lin covered the surface swiftly with vibrant ink lines, infusing the work with texture and a sense of spontaneity. Traces of a melancholy spirit—lonely figures in a landscape, barren trees—reflect perhaps the artist’s longing to escape. Upon returning to China at age 26, Lin was appointed to the prestigious position of head of the newly established art academy in Beijing; he later held a similar post at the Hangzhou Art Academy. Lin and his students, such as Wu Guanzhong and Zao Wou-ki (1920–2013), are regarded among the most creative and accomplished artists in navigating Impressionism and abstraction in Chinese painting. In 1977, soon after the conclusion of the Cultural Revolution, Lin took up permanent residence in Hong Kong and devoted his time solely to painting.",,,Painting,Image: H. 11 3/4 in × W. 14 3/4 in (29.8 cm × 37.5 cm),Gift of Barbara J.

There is substantial evidence for the importance of Islamic art at his court. The success of Zheng He's exploration (see cat. no. 65) further encouraged the emperor's hopes of a rapprochement with other parts of the world. Foreign envoys who returned with Zheng He, bearing various tributes, particularly amazed the Yongle emperor. To better fulfill China's diplomatic missions, as well as to reap the benefits of trade, myriad Chinese products were prepared for Zheng He's fleets. The most valuable good that China could produce in mass quantities during this era was porcelain. A 1988 excavation by archaeologists found ruin strata of early Ming-dynasty official kilns in Jingdezhen. Remains of large porcelain plates, bowls, and jars discovered in the Yongle-period stratum are now known to have been created as exports for Islamic markets. Never in the history of Chinese ceramic manufacture had as many foreigninspired forms taken shape as in the Yongle emperor's factories. Certain forms among these were even adopted for use in the imperial palaces and temples. One statistic suggests that nine out of twenty-one whiteglazed ceremonial types have forms originating in Islamic metalwork (Urban Council et al. 1989, pp. 22 – 23, pl. 1, 4 – 6, 8 – 9, 11, 13, 22). Three of those nine types are represented by this group of water utensils from the Asian Art Museum collection, demonstrating the Yongle emperor's preference for the Islamic style. They share similaritiesin their precise potting, refined clay, and smooth glaze without air bubbles. Decorations were rendered in quality materials with precious cobalt imported from the Islamic world, producing distinctive color and luster. Painted on the clay body, the cobalt, with its high iron and low magnesium content, turned to dark blue through glazing and firing, with irregular ferruginous strains where it had curdled. The decorative subjects on these three works combine motifs from different sources: the Chinese traditional meander and flowers, stylized arabesques of Islamic influence, and the Buddhist Eight Treasures and essential lotus.",,"Ming dynasty (1368-1644), Reign of the Yongle emperor (1403-1424)-Reign of the Xuande emperor (1426-1435)",Ceramics,"H. 14 1/2 in x Diam. 7 in x W.. 8 1/8  in, H. 36.8 cm x W. 17.8 cm x D. 20.6 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60P85,Porcelain with underglaze cobalt decoration,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/74112/preview,Handled ewer with a spout

At the same time, China's interest in outward exploration helped open trade routes through which large quantities of ceramics were exported. In the early 1400s the Muslim admiral Zheng He led Chinese naval fleets on a series of expeditions around the world. Meanwhile, other countries were developing their own blue-and-white technologies. In Korea, King Seizong (1418-1450) ordered artisans at the official kiln Gwangju-gun in Gyeonggi-do to make porcelains decorated with Chinese cobalt. The discovery of Korean cobalt in 1464 stimulated local production of exquisitely painted blue-and-white ceramics. In the early 1600s Japanese potters began using clay that could be fired at high temperatures in new, more efficient ""climbing kilns.""

This method ingeniously prevents colorful designs from wearing out, and has had lasting effects on porcelain worldwide. Underglaze painted products of the Tang dynasty, some using imported cobalt (later known as blue-and-whites), joined the stream of Chinese trade with Southeast and West Asia. Unfortunately, a shortage of imported cobalt forced Chinese potters to use local cobalt, which produced a rather dull blue. During the period of the Mongol domination of China, Persia, and Central Asia in the 1200s and 1300s, however, overland trade routes opened up, and Chinese potters were able to import high-quality cobalt from Central Asia more easily. Chinese potters were exposed to and greatly influenced by exotic designs on the underglaze-painted ceramics and the metal and glass artifacts that flowed in from the Persian world. Artisans at Jingdezhen, the center of porcelain production in southeastern China, revived the underglaze technique and produced porcelains with brilliantly painted decorations in imported cobalt. These wares then became popular and sought after in Persia and throughout the rest of Asia.",,,Ceramics,"H. 2 1/4 in x Diam. 4 1/2 in, H. 5.7 cm x Diam. 11.4 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60P1908,Glazed fritware with underglaze decoration,"probably Kashan, Iran",West Asian Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/65727/preview,Bowl with running rabbit

This technique, known as “mercury gilding,” involved an application of a paste-like mixture of gold and mercury on bronze to create a gilded surface, which also gave the metal greater resistance to tarnishing. The bronze was heated by charcoal fire to evaporate the mercury, leaving the gold bonded to its surface. This gold surface layer was then burnished with a hard, smooth metal or stone tool to make it more compact and shiny. The use of gold on bronze in China dates back more than two thousand years, and this high-cost technique was traditionally used for luxurious decorations and icons. Many bronze-cast buddha and bodhisattva statues were adorned with this gilding technique to attract more devotees. Small, lustrous figures and icons like these in the cases were carried for spiritual protection on journeys and placed on household altars for worship.

This technique, known as “mercury gilding,” involved an application of a paste-like mixture of gold and mercury on bronze to create a gilded surface, which also gave the metal greater resistance to tarnishing. The bronze was heated by charcoal fire to evaporate the mercury, leaving the gold bonded to its surface. This gold surface layer was then burnished with a hard, smooth metal or stone tool to make it more compact and shiny. The use of gold on bronze in China dates back more than two thousand years, and this high-cost technique was traditionally used for luxurious decorations and icons. Many bronze-cast buddha and bodhisattva statues were adorned with this gilding technique to attract more devotees. Small, lustrous figures and icons like these in the cases were carried for spiritual protection on journeys and placed on household altars for worship. It is important to note that many altar shrines were made in segments and then assembled, and so over the centuries some have lost attachments or have had parts from similar-sized works reattached.",,Qing dynasty (1644-1911),Sculpture,H. 9 1/2 in x W. 4 1/2 in x D. 3 5/8 in,The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60B1057.a-.b,Bronze with gilding,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/55247/preview,Buddha

The top front register, framed by two dragons, illustrates a debate between Vimalakirti, a wealthy layman, and Manjushri, the bodhisattva of wisdom. Their encounter resonated with Chinese Buddhists because it demonstrated how a person could participate in a discussion of Buddhist doctrine on equal terms with a bodhisattva—a perfected, enlightened being. It reassured people that it was possible to honor Buddhist spiritual values but also pursue financial stability and take care of one’s family—an obligation embedded in Confucianism, China’s native state philosophy. The stele also includes images of Shakyamuni’s disciples, monks, and important bodhisattvas. The theme of rebirth in a Buddhist paradise is represented by four reborn souls emerging from the lotus blossoms on the canopy above the main image. In many Buddhist traditions it is believed that making images of the Buddha is an act of merit for both artist and patron. In China, groups of lay Buddhists often pooled their resources to commission large stone plaques shown as steles.

,,278 BCE,,Warring States period (approx. 475-221 BCE),,,Not on view,images_china/asian_china216.jpg,,"戰國秦昭襄王 29 年（前 278 年）銘文 彩繪 雲鳳紋漆卮 The covered lacquer vessel is one of the objects in the Asian's collections that can be directly associated with the state of Qin. A little background on the medium: Lacquer is made of the sap of a member of the rhus family, which also contains poison ivy and poison sumac. The sap contains a very high level of urushiol, the chemical in these plants that causes dermatitis on contact. Raw lacquer is a thick liquid that can be applied as paint or used as a resin, much like the resin for fiberglass. Under the right conditions, it will undergo a chemical change that creates a substance not unlike modern plastic. It is very durable and can withstand exposure to heat and liquids. Urushiol in its raw state is very caustic and only a limited number of stable materials can be used as pigments. For much of the history of lacquer in China these pigments were browns and blacks derived from carbon, and red from cinnabar. Traditionally the primary centers of lacquer production in China have been along the Yangtze River. Lacquered objects dating from as early as 3000 BCE have been found in archaeological sites in this region; the lacquer has survived in remarkably good condition-the issue is with the cores, which are most often made of wood. Over thousands of years of burial, water invariably penetrates the wood cores which swell and then shrink when they dry. That is the explanation for the wrinkled surface on this piece. In its original form it would have been smooth and shiny with very clearly demarcated designs. The level of workmanship for this piece is remarkable. The basic core consists of a circular wood base with six very thin and slightly curved pieces of wood making up the walls. The pieces of wood do not appear to have been joined in any way, though it is likely they were glued together, perhaps with lacquer. The wood is covered both inside and out with a single layer of textile. Either the fabric was impregnated with lacquer before it was applied or lacquer was applied directly to it to create a strong and durable object. Close examination indicates an additional layer of lacquer was applied as a filler to smooth out the imperfections in the surface before the finish coats were applied. The finish coats are in black with designs added in red and brown. The interior of the vessel is red. The three ears on the lid, the handle and the base with three attached legs are cast bronze. Again, there is no clear evidence of mechanical attachments like nails, instead it appears the lacquer serves as an adhesive holding these appendages to the lacquered wood body; there are two holes in each end of the bronze handle, with a groove between them, suggesting that it was tied or wired to something. There is no original lacquer around the handle, so we really don't know for certain if it is even original to this object, though the inlaid decoration matches the other fittings. The elaborate designs on the bronze appear to have been incised and then inlaid with silver. They relate closely to the designs painted in red on the black lacquer surface. By the time this piece was created, lacquered objects were far more expensive than bronze; vessels like this one were objects of prestige. During the Eastern Zhou dynasty Chu, which occupied the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, was the state best known for lacquer production. A 1956 publication in Chinese indicates that this piece was excavated in Changsha in Hunan province, one of the major centers of Chu culture. Included in the red lacquer decoration on the lid of this vessel are two designs which can be read as the Chinese character chang (檉's mark. An inscription is incised on the bottom and with it the story of this remarkable piece gets much more complex and challenging. Incising or carving decoration into lacquer objects was just beginning to appear as a decorative strategy in the late Warring States period and the Qin dynasty. In fact, this could be the earliest incised inscription with a date on any surviving Chinese lacquer. The inscription starts with a date: the twenty ninth year, and goes on to state that a dowager queen (tai hou太后 A Chinese scholar has suggested the queen mentioned in the inscription might be the dowager queen Xuan (died 265 BCE) who was a native Chu and mother of King Zhao of Qin who died in 251BCE. If so, the date of the piece would be 278 BCE, making it the earliest surviving example of a Chinese lacquer with a date. Unfortunately, the date does not contain the ruler's name, just the twenty-ninth year. That leaves the actual date open to conjecture; there are several issues with the 278 BCE date. Qin was not a center of lacquer production until its conquest of Chu territories in 278 BCE. The areas conquered included the Chu capital of Ying, located near the modern city of Jiangling in Hubei province. No doubt centers of lacquer production were also included in the conquered areas. It is possible that the vessel could be spoils of war but that would not explain the style of the calligraphy used in the inscription, the association with a Qin queen, or the fact that it was reported excavated from a tomb in Changsha, which in 278 BCE was still in Chu territory. It seems highly unlikely that the Qin would have been able to put into place the level of bureaucracy suggested in the inscription in the same year they made these conquests. The piece might have been the property of the dowager queen brought Qin as part of her dowry. Again, that does not explain the style of the calligraphy. Also, there is no evidence in existing Chu documents of the complex bureaucracy associated with the creation of lacquers suggested by the inscription. This is far more typical of the state of Qin. Also, makers' marks are very rare on Chu state lacquers. I do not know of any. The more likely explanation is the date is not the twenty ninth year of King X, but rather the 29th year of the reign of the First Emperor himself. That would be equivalent to 218 BCE. Such a date would explain all the issues raised above. The problem with this date is the Shiji states that the First Emperor's mother died in the 17th year of his reign. That is equivalent to 230 BCE. An explanation might be found in the reading of the fourth and fifth characters of the inscription. As mentioned above this has been read as tai hou (太后大司","18 insided characters:  廿九年大后詹事丞向/右工帀（師）象工大人臺/長

In the early 1400s the Muslim admiral Zheng He led Chinese naval fleets on a series of expeditions around the world. Meanwhile, other countries were developing their own blue-and-white technologies. In Korea, King Seizong (1418-1450) ordered artisans at the official kiln Gwangju-gun in Gyeonggi-do to make porcelains decorated with Chinese cobalt.

There is substantial evidence for the importance of Islamic art at his court. The success of Zheng He's exploration (see cat. no. 65) further encouraged the emperor's hopes of a rapprochement with other parts of the world. Foreign envoys who returned with Zheng He, bearing various tributes, particularly amazed the Yongle emperor. To better fulfill China's diplomatic missions, as well as to reap the benefits of trade, myriad Chinese products were prepared for Zheng He's fleets. The most valuable good that China could produce in mass quantities during this era was porcelain. A 1988 excavation by archaeologists found ruin strata of early Ming-dynasty official kilns in Jingdezhen. Remains of large porcelain plates, bowls, and jars discovered in the Yongle-period stratum are now known to have been created as exports for Islamic markets. Never in the history of Chinese ceramic manufacture had as many foreigninspired forms taken shape as in the Yongle emperor's factories. Certain forms among these were even adopted for use in the imperial palaces and temples. One statistic suggests that nine out of twenty-one whiteglazed ceremonial types have forms originating in Islamic metalwork (Urban Council et al. 1989, pp. 22 – 23, pl. 1, 4 – 6, 8 – 9, 11, 13, 22). Three of those nine types are represented by this group of water utensils from the Asian Art Museum collection, demonstrating the Yongle emperor's preference for the Islamic style. They share similarities in their precise potting, refined clay, and smooth glaze without air bubbles. Decorations were rendered in quality materials with precious cobalt imported from the Islamic world, producing distinctive color and luster. Painted on the clay body, the cobalt, with its high iron and low magnesium content, turned to dark blue through glazing and firing, with irregular ferruginous strains where it had curdled. The decorative subjects on these three works combine motifs from different sources: the Chinese traditional meander and flowers, stylized arabesques of Islamic influence, and the Buddhist Eight Treasures and essential lotus.",,"Ming dynasty (1368-1644), Reign of the Yongle emperor (1403-1424)",Ceramics,"H. 5 3/8 in x Diam. 6 in,  H. 13.6 cm x Diam. 15.2 cm",Gift of Roy Leventritt,,B69P16L,Porcelain with underglaze cobalt decoration,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/23638/preview,Ewer with a handle

The dragon has many distinct characteristics: horns like a stag, head like a camel, neck like a snake, eyes like an eagle, claws like a hawk, palms like a tiger, and ears like an ox. The mythical creatures are bearded with whiskers and typically breathe fire. Historically, there are three types of dragons; the lung, the most powerful, inhabits the sky; the hornless li lives in the ocean; and the scaly chiao dwells in marshes and dens in the ocean. The dragon symbolizes high rank and power. Perhaps as long as three thousand years ago, it became the emblem of kings and emperors.

Imaginative, refreshing and technically daring as it is, this trend is the swan song of an art that had been self-sufficient for a thousand years. With few exceptions, shapes are plain, if not pedestrian. The now completely secularized metal is used as a mere background for designs that are for the most part borrowed from other media, such as painting, and are no longer adapted to the anatomy of the containers. Three or these vessels, the dui (B60B1080) and the two hu (B60B30+, B60B1079) bear designs of copper inlay. At first, as in the dui , the decor was done in incised lines filled with copper thread. Later on, as in the case of the two hu , decorative motifs were carved and then filled with copper foil cut-outs in a manner resembling niello work. The asymmetric hu (back left, B60B30+) is another of the few new shapes that saw the light during the late 6th century BCE Its decor is so close in its execution to that of the tall standard hu (B60B1079,which happens to be the biggest vessel of its kind in existence) next to it that it is not unreasonable to assume that both vessels were produced by the same workshop. From top to foot these vessels are covered with narrow circular belts containing a variety of curvilinear, almost calligraphic zoomorphic and geometric motifs. This dense population is shown in profile and according to the most demanding laws or symmetry at least where the tall hu is concerned. In addition vertical and horizontal axes are marked by geometric figures, mainly H-shaped. Some of the motifs such as the regardant dragons can be traced back to the main stream of ancestral bronze decor. Others are revolutionary. For instance, arched felines, which do not antedate the second hair of the 6th century BCE. The handles of both vessels and the spurred rings on top or the lid of the tall Hu with their full round animal masks or their incised details are concessions made to the prevalent taste of the day.",,,Metal Arts,H. 12 in x W. 5 3/8 in,The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60B1079,Bronze,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/58610/preview,Ritual wine vessel (hu)

Eventually Zhao chose to die by hunger strike, thus demonstrating his dedication to safeguarding the Song dynasty. Years later, the new emperor Xiaozong (reigned 1163–1189) restored Zhao’s reputation and granted him the posthumous title Faithful Being. In this painting Zhao Ding stands in a dignified pose, presenting a tablet hu, a kind of ritual scepter, as though at the imperial court.

Later on, as in the case of the two hu , decorative motifs were carved and then filled with copper foil cut-outs in a manner resembling niello work. The dui (B60B1080) is one of the earliest specimens of a new, near-spherical shape. With its three spurred, ring-like feet, the cover can be used as a bowl in its own right and can only be told from the lower part of the vessel in that it is not equipped with handles. The center of the cupola is occupied by a geometrical design comprising a composite whorl-circle bordered by a twisted rope pattern and, on the outside, a row of eight heart-shaped lappets. The rest of the decor consists of seven identical hybrid felines, three on the cover and four on the bowl.

There are many reasons for the popularity of cinnabar: for one, the Chinese term for this shade of red is zhu, which is the same character as the surname of the ruling family of the Ming dynasty. Red was also the dynastic color for the Ming and a color that represents happiness and good fortune to the Chinese. A sophisticated understanding of the medium was required before carved lacquers could be created. In order to undergo the chemical change required for curing, lacquer must be applied in thin coats. The thick coverings necessary for carving are achieved by applying multiple coats. The most complex carved lacquers might have a thin wood core reinforced with a layer of lacquer-impregnated cloth; base coats created by adding combinations of ash, rice paste, wood powder, or fine clay to lacquer; and multiple finish coats of refined lacquer. Each coat has special qualities of sealing, filling, leveling, and finishing, and must be applied in the proper conditions and in proper sequence. Since each coat must be cured and mechanically smoothed before another is added, the thickest applications can require as much as a year from the initial coat to the final finish. (The complexity of these applications are well described in Ohba 1988.) These technical challenges had been overcome by the Song dynasty, making possible the elaborately carved works for which the Ming is famous. This piece presents a long-tailed bird in a garden bordered by flowers of the four seasons. The theme of birds in a garden setting or with a floral background can be traced back to themes for painting at the Southern Song court.

With the rise of new philosophical developments, emperors of the Song dynasty desired to align themselves with China’s past rulers, and possession of antique artifacts implied equal stature with the wise rulers of ancient times. Ritual bronzes were amassed and catalogued, and records of these collections were published using woodblock-print illustrations. Ming and Qing rulers were decidedly more political in their artistic sensibilities, laying claim on the past as a form of legitimacy. This later form of archaism was more complex, as it drew sources not only from bronze vessels of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, but also from Song interpretations of earlier bronzes, ceramics, and jade, thus at times resulting in copies of more ancient copies. By and large, the shapes of Ming and Qing ceramics were based on earlier metal forms, yet their glaze techniques imitated those popular during the more recent Song dynasty.

Along with bronze mirrors, comma-shaped beads, and other stone and shell artifacts, the bracelets are generally associated with shamanistic practices. Armor and weaponry prominently appear in tombs later in the Kofun period and represent a shift toward objects that reflect the military and economic power base of the deceased. Bronze Mirrors Because of their reflective properties, mirrors were believed to have magical powers. Archaeologists have excavated many imported and Japanese-made mirrors from the burial chambers in early tomb mounds (kofun), and mirrors show up with some frequency in later tombs as well. In some burial sites they have found one mirror placed against the skull with others arrayed around the body of the deceased. Archaeologists theorize that these mirrors may be related to shamanistic beliefs and rituals, and in some cases may have been distributed among Japan’s early elites to signify political affiliations among rulers. Kofun mirrors have a polished, reflective side and a back side decorated in relief (the sides displayed here). The central knob on the mirror’s back would have been threaded with a cord to make it easy to hold. Images of deities and beasts, as well as geometric shapes, are incorporated into the complex designs of these mirrors. The mirrors in this case were made of bronze in China or in Japan during the Kofun period (250–552). The exact origin of each mirror has not yet been conclusively determined.

Geyi, August 1973. The large, bold, and free brushstrokes used to create the vines and the bright colors used to create the flowers of the morning glory in this painting are typical of paintings of the Shanghai school. This school arose during the last half of the 1800s, when Shanghai became one of China's great port cities. The wealth of that city created a demand for bold and decorative paintings for display in their mansions, and for this purpose relatively simple but expressive ""big brush"" paintings were created in large numbers by an ever-expanding group of artists. By the early part of the twentieth century the Shanghai school had become internationally renowned. Wang Geyi was one of the last artists active in this style. He studied painting with the great master Wu Changshi (1844–1927) and was associated with other great early twentieth-century painters such as Wang Zhen (Wang Yiting, 1867–1938) and Zhang Daqian (1899–1983).

Along with bronze mirrors, comma-shaped beads, and other stone and shell artifacts, the bracelets are generally associated with shamanistic practices. Armor and weaponry prominently appear in tombs later in the Kofun period and represent a shift toward objects that reflect the military and economic power base of the deceased. Bronze Mirrors Because of their reflective properties, mirrors were believed to have magical powers. Archaeologists have excavated many imported and Japanese-made mirrors from the burial chambers in early tomb mounds (kofun), and mirrors show up with some frequency in later tombs as well. In some burial sites they have found one mirror placed against the skull with others arrayed around the body of the deceased. Archaeologists theorize that these mirrors may be related to shamanistic beliefs and rituals, and in some cases may have been distributed among Japan’s early elites to signify political affiliations among rulers. Kofun mirrors have a polished, reflective side and a back side decorated in relief (the sides displayed here). The central knob on the mirror’s back would have been threaded with a cord to make it easy to hold. Images of deities and beasts, as well as geometric shapes, are incorporated into the complex designs of these mirrors. The mirrors in this case were made of bronze in China or in Japan during the Kofun period (250–552). The exact origin of each mirror has not yet been conclusively determined. The appearance of imported mirrors among the grave goods of this period is evidence of early trade and diplomatic connections between Japan and its mainland neighbors.

Due to the difficulties involved in working the stone, most early jade objects have relatively flat surfaces and finely incised decoration.

,,approx. 1900,,,,,Not on view,images_china/asian_china488.jpg,,"Because of its location along the Straits of Melaka, the city of Palembang in southeast Sumatra became an important trading port between China and India. As early as the 1100s, Chinese silk was imported to Sumatra. Textiles became one of the most important items of trade and were used as prestige markers and exchanged as ritual gifts. Silk textiles produced abroad were especially valued by the courts of the region. By the mid-1600s India, rather than China, was the major exporter of fabric to Indonesia, with more than a million pieces traded between 1652 and 1653 alone. In the 1680s the Dutch established a monopoly on trade of textiles from India and began demanding high prices for them; in response, manufacture of textiles in Palembang burgeoned. Local weaving traditions established in that era have continued to the present day. The production of high-quality textiles was a pastime of court women, who could afford to buy the imported silk and gold thread used in the most spectacular pieces. Historical records indicate that noblewomen in the Palembang courts were frequently of Chinese descent, and some scholars have described the prominent use of gold and red, as well as the floral patterning seen on textiles of this sort, as indications of Chinese influence. The women were esteemed as much for their ability to dye the threads as for their skill in weaving. The pattern on the body of this textile was created using a technique called ikat, in which the threads are tie-dyed with the pattern before the textile is woven. In the case of this cloth the weft, or fibers running across the width of the fabric, were tie-dyed before being woven through the warp, the fibers attached lengthwise to the loom. Each of the colors seen on this cloth indicates a separate dipping of the threads of the cloth in dye. The ends of the cloth are decorated with a supplementary weft technique in which an additional set of gold threads are woven on top of the background. Textiles of this kind often show the stylized wings of a garuda (a mythical bird from Indian mythology), but in this case what seems to be depicted is the whole body of a bird in flight.",,,Textiles,"H. 33 7/8 in x W. 78 3/4 in, H. 86.02 cm x W. 200.02 cm",Gift of the Georgia Sales Collection,,1998.74,Silk and metallic thread,"Palembang, Sumatra, Indonesia",Southeast Asian Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/3504/preview,Shoulder cloth (limar)

Ritual bronzes were amassed and catalogued, and records of these collections were published using woodblock-print illustrations. Ming and Qing rulers were decidedly more political in their artistic sensibilities, laying claim on the past as a form of legitimacy. This later form of archaism was more complex, as it drew sources not only from bronze vessels of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, but also from Song interpretations of earlier bronzes, ceramics, and jade, thus at times resulting in copies of more ancient copies.

The inside of the tube is round; the outside has three corners, each at a 75-degree angle, evenly spaced. Each corner is decorated with a monster-mask design in a series of incised intaglio lines. The piece was catalogued as a jade of the Neolithic Liangzhu culture in 1994 (Asian Art Museum 1994, 128). Recent archaeological finds have disproved the idea—held for 1,000 years—that the cong tube was a ritual object originating in the Bronze Age. Neolithic Liangzhu graves in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have yielded various jade cong forms. The form with a deity's mask design was associated with the gods, and powerful people possessed these images to symbolize their exalted positions. The ruling class through the centuries used the cong during ceremonial worship of the universe. The cong, one of the well-documented six auspicious jades, has been copied through all periods in China's history. The most obvious sign that this piece is a reproduction is the artisan's use of new jade material not seen in the Liangzhu culture. Another sign is that the tool marks in the even line work on the masks were made by metal tools (Mou Yongkang, 1996). Before the Bronze Age, Liangzhu jade was worked with soft tools of leather or animal bone or with stone implements. In addition, the meander and triangle patterns on the mask are misinterpretations of Liangzhu mask designs.",,Qing dynasty (1644-1911) or Republic period (1912-1949),Jade And Stones,"H. 1 1/16 in x Diam. 2 7/8 in x D. 1/4 in, H. 2.7 cm x Diam. 7.3 cm x D. .64 cm","Transfer from the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, Gift of Albert M.

The use of iron first became widespread during this period, and this, combined with advances in agriculture, allowed for a degree of prosperity at many levels of society. Reflecting the richness of the period, a variety of stylistic trends developed in bronze vessels.

Although Zhong had an ugly face, his sister was an exceptional beauty. In gratitude to his best friend, Du Ping, for a lifetime of support, Zhong Kui allowed his sister to marry Du. This tale later became a popular subject and generations of artists depicted this imagined scene in various styles and mediums. Many paintings show the demon queller seeing his sister off in a palanquin, accompanied by a procession of little demons. The oldest son of the famous painter Fu Baoshi, Fu Xiaoshi graduated from the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 1958 and joined Jiangsu Art Academy. Like his father, Fu Xiaoshi painted mostly historical figures. His works do not, however, resemble those of the elder Fu, who is known for elegant figures in lyric landscapes. Xiaoshi had a stroke in 1979 and lost the use of his right hand. Painting with his left hand, Xiaoshi defined his figures with broad applications of ink and color washes rather than with refined outlines, and there is a looser and more abbreviated quality to his painting.

Many copies, and various editions based upon it, were known not only in China but also in Japan and Korea. A second printed edition of the Canon, prepared under the guidance of the chief priests of the Dongchan Temple in Fuzhou, began to be published (in installments) in the late eleventh century. More than one-and-a-half times the length of the earlier publication, it was widely admired and became the model for future editions of the Canon through the Ming dynasty. Unlike the earlier editions, which had been mounted as handscrolls, the Dongchan Temple edition was printed on scroll-length sheets of paper that were folded accordion style. In the number of characters and lines per page, it followed the format of earlier hand-copied manuscripts. Preparation of a printed Buddhist canon was a massive undertaking.

Between the Chinese Southern Song (1127–1279) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties, a series of renowned sites on this lake were designated as “Views of West Lake.” These views became a popular theme for both Chinese and Japanese artists—although artists from Japan were prohibited from traveling to China, and thus had to rely on printed and painted images of the lake for inspiration. These screens by the Japanese artist Ike Taiga cover the course of a year, depicting different parts of West Lake with varying seasonal indicators. They showcase Taiga’s impressive range of brushwork and ink, and his remarkable ability to transform Chinese models into a distinctive style of his own. Description of right-screen panels, from right to left: 蘇堤春暁 1. Spring Dawn on the Su Causeway Taiga captures the six stone arches of the Su Causeway, depicted from a bird’s-eye view, in simple, bold, and dry brushstrokes. Willow leaves in blue and red peach blossoms indicate the springtime. 西溪探梅 2. Seeking Plum Blossoms at West Stream Located in the western region of the lake, this site has been famous for plum blossom viewing since the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) when three thousand plum trees were planted here. 花港観魚 3.

Evening Bell at Nanping Hill Since the 1100s, Jingci temple on Nanping Hill has been a pilgrimage site for Japanese priests and scholars.

The fact that togchas are found by chance by Tibetan peasants working in the fields or picked up by nomads in the highlands has led to the belief that they were not created by human hands but “fell from the sky” due to the effects of thunder and lightning. Tibetans wear togchas on their bodies and fondle them with their hands; some togchas develop a patina from constant handling. Togchas, although found in Tibet, are not necessarily Tibetan in origin.

Such wares were first made in China, and became some of the most admired ceramics in the world. China's neighbors Korea, Japan, and Thailand were eager to create celadon wares of their own that would equal the beauty of the Chinese versions. Celadon became an important item in international trade. Chinese celadons had always been sought after in Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia. They had also been exported in quantity to Persia, Turkey, and Egypt from the 1100s onward. Celadons were so valuable in trade that ceramics workshops in Thailand produced large numbers of them to compete with the Chinese for sales in Indonesia and the Philippines. Between 1000 and 1400 Korea produced a jade-like celadon admired by connoisseurs all over the world.

Vietnamese wares of this period have been found from Japan to Turkey, but the primary market for these ceramics was Southeast Asia. All of the items in this case were excavated from a shipwreck found off the coast of Vietnam near the city of Hoi An. It is believed this ship originated in Siam (now known as Thailand) and was one of many vessels sailing between that country and the north coast of Vietnam. Much of the cargo may have been destined for Indonesia, where similar objects have been found. Excavation of the vessel yielded over a quarter-million items. The skill of the artists can be seen in the wide variety of wares produced as well as in the range of motifs-from floral to fantastic. Chinese Ceramics for Asian Markets For more than a thousand years, China has been exporting large quantities of ceramics to other Asian countries, and the trade in pottery and porcelain has been an important component of the world economy. Some areas, such as the islands of Indonesia, did not have large-scale ceramics industries of their own. Others, such as Japan, Persia, and Siam (now known as Thailand), had such industries but still wanted Chinese wares, some of which were technically superior to most of their locally made wares. Merchants and suppliers learned early on that they could sell more of their products by customizing them for the needs and tastes of various foreign markets. For instance, Persia would buy large plates on which to serve dishes such as pilaf, and Siam would buy teapots decorated by the Chinese with Thai designs.",,"Qing dynasty (1644-1911), Reign of the Daoguang emperor (1821-1850)",Ceramics,H. 6 1/4 in x Dia. 9 in; H. 15.9 cm x Dia. 22.9 cm,Gift of Mrs. James Rudden,,2010.430.a-.b,Stoneware with marine deposits,"Jiangsu province, China",Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/10514/preview,Teapot

The defining characteristic of these vessels is that they have a mouth and a spout but no separate handle. This pouring vessel, usually of metal, seems to have been commonly used in ancient India for several purposes. It was convenient and hygienic to drink from because the liquid could be poured into the mouth without the lips touching the vessel. Also, such vessels were used for pouring holy water or other liquids in religious rituals. In artistic representations, kundika are shown being held by certain deities, both Hindu and Buddhist. The form reached China, Korea, and Japan with the spread of Buddhism. The kendi (a Malay/Indonesian term) is a variation of the kundika; usually of rather squat proportions and made of ceramic, kendi were widely used in Southeast Asia.

Not until a year later, though, when he was inspired by his studio's surroundings, did Hanmu actually write this colophon. Sitting in the studio on a rainy autumn day, enjoying antiques nearby and green pine trees outside, Hanmu felt his world was the remote peaceful ""peach blossom village"" described by the poet Tao Qian (365–427). The political turmoil that marked the end of the Ming dynasty forced Fu Shan to flee in 1644 to a village in northwest China, hundreds of miles from his home. This period of exile was to last through 1652. As an expression of his grief, sorrow, and anger, Fu wrote seventeen short pieces in various styles; all seventeen are preserved in this handscroll.

毛錐不殺賊，吟情附雙淚。男兒生何為，壯業雕蟲蔽。悲壯浣花老，顛躓雍梁際。忠憤發全聲，誰識此翁志。當年事如何，哥舒失險備。上皇樂游覽，八駿馭西轡。翠葆駐蠶叢，百靈擁先帝。靈武正飛龍，四海仰新制。行在尚可達，不負間關致。元勳推郭李，河山破復易。口號記天誅，劍外喜收薊，哀哉生不辰，英雄遁何地。絕裾懲太真，棲棲尸饔計。知名不賞藥，月露遂成祟。投筆起新聲，雄劍為誰礪？老衲好客詩，七字知客意。

Perhaps best known for applying ink in innovative ways that created unconventional abstractions, Liu also manipulated paper by various means—tearing, collaging, brushing ink onto both sides, and pulling fibers off the surface. In 1969 Liu embarked on a new artistic phase. Influenced by photographs of the Earth and the moon sent back from the Apollo 7 mission, he began to incorporate circles and spheres into his already abstract compositions. The Which is Earth? series was created in the first year of Liu's ""space painting"" period (1969–1972). During this period he created some three hundred works in virtually the same style, the only variations being the choice of colors and the quantity and size of the circles. Liu Guosong was born in Shandong, a northeastern province in China, in 1932. Arriving in Taipei in 1949, he took up formal art study at Normal University and became interested in Western art.

This scroll painting depicts one section, perhaps the northern shore, of the iconic West Lake of Hangzhou, China. West Lake, a freshwater lake surrounded by mountains on three sides, was a popular subject for both Chinese and Japanese painters because of its formidable beauty and enduring literary associations. The artist distinguishes this specific spot of West Lake by incorporating two arched bridges—which viewers at the time would have recognized as the Bai and Su Causeways that divide the lake. Like most of the Japanese Nanga artists who painted scenes of West Lake, Buson never actually laid eyes on his inspiration. This was due to the self-imposed isolation policy of the Japanese government between 1639 and 1854, which prohibited all Japanese from leaving the country.

The wealth of jade objects found in elite tombs is a strong indication that, even this early in Chinese history, people had been divided into social classes. These objects also show that skilled artisans were already capable of working a stone that is harder than many metals. The Chinese reverence for jade began in this early period. Due to the difficulties involved in working the stone, most early jade objects have relatively flat surfaces and finely incised decoration. While the function of the earliest prehistoric Chinese implements is unknown to us, their location in tombs and ritual structures indicates they were highly valued. Shapes such as the bi, a flat disk with a hole in the middle, and the cong, a squarish tube with a hole drilled though the center, have a longer history of continuous use in Chinese rituals than any other objects.

Often these pieces were discovered by fishers, who pulled up objects when trawling the ocean floor. The ceramics in their nets came from some of the many shipwrecks that can still be found in the waterways where, centuries ago, huge ships carried cargoes of trade wares. In the past few decades, underwater archaeologists have been able to scientifically excavate several of these shipwrecks, providing us with invaluable information not only about the types of ceramics produced but also about larger patterns of maritime trade. Although China dominated the maritime ceramic trade for centuries, shipwrecks containing cargoes full of wares from Thailand and Vietnam indicate the growing competition from Southeast Asia for the export market.",,Tang dynasty (618-907),Ceramics,"H. 2 in x Diam. 6 in, H. 5.1 cm x Diam. 15.2 cm",Acquisition made possible by Margaret Polak,,2000.26,High fired ceramic with underglaze polychrome decoration,"Changsha, Hunan province, China",Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/4056/preview,Bowl with flowers

Introduced to the Qing court by Europeans in the late 1600s, snuff taking became an imperial habit, and many bottles were produced for the court. Besides clearing one’s sinuses, snuff was also believed to relieve headaches, and by the early nineteenth century its inhalation had become a widespread practice in China. Early examples were simple in form, but by the late 1700s medicinal bottles had evolved into beautiful works of art that were viewed as collectors’ items. The appeal of these bottles to collectors continues to this day. Snuff bottles are a reflection of Chinese art in miniature form. They are especially rich in Chinese symbols because, as objects carried on one’s person, they reflect the sentiments of their owners.

The defining characteristic of these vessels is that they have a mouth and a spout but no separate handle. This pouring vessel, usually of metal, seems to have been commonly used in ancient India for several purposes. It was convenient and hygienic to drink from because the liquid could be poured into the mouth without the lips touching the vessel. Also, such vessels were used for pouring holy water or other liquids in religious rituals. In artistic representations, kundika are shown being held by certain deities, both Hindu and Buddhist. The form reached China, Korea, and Japan with the spread of Buddhism. The kendi (a Malay/Indonesian term) is a variation of the kundika; usually of rather squat proportions and made of ceramic, kendi were widely used in Southeast Asia. The demand for these vessels in Indonesia was so great that they were produced in China, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam and exported to Indonesia.",,,Ceramics,"H. 7 in x W. 8 1/4 in x D. 7 in, H. 17.8 cm x W. 21 cm x D. 17.8 cm",Gift of James and Elaine Connell,,2018.149,Stoneware with cobalt decoration under glaze,Northern Vietnam,Southeast Asian Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/57579/preview,Pouring vessel (kendi)

Scores of Chinese folk stories express the desire for happiness in marriage and tell tales of love. In addition, folk customs that secured a fortuitous marriage once went hand in hand with traditional symbols for a harmonious marriage: It was fabled that a certain bride, on leaving the house of her parents to go to that of her husband, was met and devoured by a tiger. [Therefore], in the past, the parents of the bridegroom, to prevent so serious a catastrophe, suspended a piece of meat at the door, as a bribe to this cruel monster. Suspending a looking-glass within the marriage bed was thought to expel all evil spirits that may enter, for evil spirits, or demons, cannot endure to see their own forms. Arranging pans of flowers around the bed was regarded as an offering to the gods to promote the birth of children. (Williams, C. A.

Several color combinations—with pigments applied either in underglaze or in colorful overglaze enamels—flourished through the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Multicolor, or “five colors” (wucai), decoration is a term applied to the combination of blue underglaze with three or more overglaze colors. The colors are applied in equal proportions; thus, no single color dominates and a balanced decoration is achieved. During the Ming dynasty, artists developed an unprecedented decorative scheme in which two or more colors were used in combination; this is sometimes called “three colors” (sancai) decoration. Pieces using this technique were produced during the reign of the Kangxi emperor (1662–1722) and are distinctive for their absence of red and their predominance of cooler colors: lavender, light yellow, and/or light green. One hallmark of Ming ceramics is the development of a stable, subtle marigold yellow. Two popular multicolor combination for yellow wares—red over yellow, and green over yellow—were developed during this time, the former employing a red overglaze on a yellow ground, and the latter a green enamel painted directly on a yellow ground.",,"Qing dynasty (1644-1911), Reign of the Yongzheng emperor (1723-1735)",Ceramics,"H. 2 1/2 in x Diam. 5 7/8 in, H. 6/3 cm x Diam. 15 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B62P153.a,Porcelain with overglaze multicolor decoration,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/21284/preview,Bowl with design of eight cranes flying through clouds

The jade, from a mine in Manasi in Xinjiang, has been given a polished, soapy luster, and the subject is similar to one on an ancient bronze. The tall vessel, mounted over a saddlelike cloth on the deer's back, is a bronze zun form, with a flaring top and a bulging waist. A series of friezes commonly seen on bronzes decorate it: panels on top shaped like banana leaves, four animal masks on the waist, and cloud patterns on the lower portion. The saddle cloth is edged in cloud heads and filled with stylized snow patterns, each consisting of six diamond-shaped panels that are repeated on the deer's body as smaller single-lined designs. At the bottom, the cloven hooves are shown by incised crevices, and small depressions are carved in the hind hooves. The piece is held in balance by the deer's horns, which curve back from its head to connect with the vessel. By the 1700s, this subject had been identified as a symbol of longevity on bronzes, a symbol that began to be used in the Tang period) (Liang Shizheng [1700–1800] 1965, vol. 2, chap. 11, pp. 33–36).

It includes techniques of carved red, carved black, and carved multicolor. “Filled-in” (xiangqian), a technique in which lacquer is inlaid with other materials. Several methods gradually evolved: filled-in gold ( qiangjin ), filled-in lacquer of different colors ( tianqi ), mother-of-pearl inlay (qianluodian), and semi-precious stone inlay ( qianbaibao ). In particular, the art of inlaying lacquer with mother-of-pearl was intensively developed during the Song era; it was also introduced to Korea and reached new apexes there (see related works in the Korean galleries). “Polish-reveal” (moxian), a method in which lacquer of one or more colors is repeatedly applied in certain areas, sometimes with a layer of gold or silver powders, to build up a design. After the ground is covered with lacquer of a new color, the entire surface is polished down to reveal the color variations and hidden patterns. This technique was introduced to Japan and developed into the famous maki-e tradition there (see related works in the Japanese galleries).",,,Decorative Arts,"H. 4 1/2 in x Diam. 4 3/4 in, H. 11.4 cm x Diam. 12.1 cm",Gift of the Connoisseurs' Council,,1997.5.a-.h,Lacquer on wood with silver foil,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/59678/preview,Cosmetics box set

In the photo you can see what this concretion looked like when it came into our collection. With exposure to air internal materials made of iron began to oxidize and the entire concretion began to slowly fall apart. With this slow disintegration, unseen objects from the interior became exposed. On the adjacent labels you can see images of some of these objects and read what we are learning from them. WHAT CAN IT TELL US? As this concretion was exposed to oxygen, metal objects within it have begun to corrode. The shapes exposed suggest perhaps there was a metal chain inside the concretion. One of the identifying features of Vietnamese ceramics of this period is the brown wash painted on the bottom of many pieces. Its purpose is still a mystery. One theory is that it was a method of marking the vessels that somehow kept track of the number of ceramics in a firing. DELVE A LITTLE DEEPER… Antlers were used in Southeast Asia for many purposes. Mature antlers could be used for knife handles, tools, and ornaments, while “antler velvet” was used for medicine. This brick-shaped carved stone object is still a puzzle to us. Vietnamese scholars have not been able to identify it. Was it part of an altar or an incense burner? Through the cracking surface of corroding material, a greenish color is evident, perhaps indicating a bronze or copper-alloy object inside the concretion. If the concretion falls apart even further, we may discover what this object is. Deep within the concretion, a Chinese coin with its distinctive square hole can be seen by X-ray. Chinese coins were used throughout Southeast Asia. t of an altar or an incense burn CLUES FROM THE WRECKAGE The ship was a hybrid Chinese–Southeast Asian model, perhaps made in Thailand. The ship was large: approx. 30 meters long by 7 meters wide. The hull was constructed with wooden dowels (a Southeast Asian technique) rather than nails (a Chinese method). The wood was teak, most likely from mainland Southeast Asia. The hold was divided by partitions (bulkheads) into water-tight compartments, a characteristic of Chinese junks. The photo to the right shows a wreck with a hold of similar construction. THE CARGO AND CREW The ship contained a vast amount of Vietnamese export ceramics. The crew was likely Southeast Asian. The upper decks had storage jars for the crew’s use, primarily of Thai origin. A skull of a woman, perhaps of Thai origin, was found. One of the jars on the upper deck retained fish bones, perhaps indicating the storage of fish sauce, a staple of mainland Southeast Asian cooking. Containers found on board stored ingredients for quids of betel, a mild stimulant used in much of Southeast Asia.",,,Ceramics,"H. 13 1/2 in x W. 32 in D. 16 in, H. 34.3 cm x W. 81.3 cm x D. 40.6 cm","Acquisition made possible by Betty and Bruce Alberts, Will and June Arney Roadman, Annie and Cameron Dorsey, Jean and Lindsay MacDermid, Rhoda Stuart Mesker, and Ann Witter",,2000.31,"Stoneware, stone, antler, shell, corroding iron, and remains of sea creatures",Vietnam,Southeast Asian Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/4065/preview,Concretion of ceramics from the Hoi An shipwreck

The inscription on the painting tells us he based this composition on wisteria vines in the Humble Administrator's Garden; legend has it that the vines were planted by the renowned painter Wen Zhengming (1470–1559). Originally built in the 1500s, this garden, located in Suzhou, is among the most famous classical gardens in China. It is considered an example of the ""Southern style"" of gardens, which used rocks, houses, water, and plants to create as many perspectives as possible within a confined space. Cheng Zhang was a native of Xiuning, Anhui province. Known for his flower-and-bird paintings and his landscapes, Cheng attracted particular notice, especially among European and American visitors to Shanghai, for his experiments with a Western approach to visual perspective.","Old wisteria in Zhuozheng yuan [Humble Administrator's Garden] stand hundreds

Just as the Chinese painter Xu Beihong (1895–1953) is known for his horse paintings, Huang Zhou became known for his lively depictions of donkeys (late 1970s–early 1980s). In this composition, Huang employed a sophisticated freehand approach to ink and wash to depict the animals in a variety of positions and from different perspectives. Using minimal brushstrokes, Huang managed simultaneously to study the donkeys' forms and to capture the feeling of their movement and energy. Huang Zhou was born in Hebei but moved to Shaanxi province during the Japanese invasion of the late 1930s. He studied painting under Zhao Wangyun (1906–1997) in Xian.

By the time this dish was made, wealthy Persians had been collecting and using Chinese blue-and-white porcelain for centuries. In 1611, the shah of Persia donated more than one thousand pieces of Chinese porcelain to a religious shrine.

Over these are worn an abundance of heavy silver jewelry in the shapes of discs and crescents, geometric forms believed to represent the origin of nature and life. The jewelry's circular shapes echo the full moon, which seems to cast a golden glow on this scene. Excelling in both pottery and printmaking, Wang Jianshan adopted waste woodblock printing because it unifies such seemingly disparate elements as the colors of oil painting, lines of Chinese painting, and texture of fresco.

Dutch archival records discuss the import of silk into parts of Sumatra, where members of the elite had specific and sometimes rapidly changing tastes. Reports from as early as 1618 describe traders bringing the gift of yellow satin to Sumatra. Sumptuary laws forbid non-nobility from wearing the color yellow.

This work has laudatory comments by seven of the leading experts on Chinese painting and calligraphy of the late-nineteenth and the early-twentieth century. Four of these comments were added after Ye Gongchao had ""rescued"" the piece from Japan, where it had been taken during the second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). This handscroll contains five compositions. The first piece, ""Memory of Central Garden,"" is arranged in two sections. It presents a moment of historical change for the Central Garden, which was actually a village on the outskirts of Chengdu, Sichuan province. The second composition, titled ""Cherishing the Memory of my Mentor, Brother Wang Muji, the Late Governor Living in Danyang,"" plays tribute to Wang Muji, a close friend and mentor of the calligrapher, and describes Wang as a honorable official who was determined to battle against enemies. The third essay, titled ""The Han Army's March on Cold Plum Temple,"" consists of three sections praising the triumph of the Han army over the Qin dynasty (221–207 BCE.). A fourth section, the seven-character poem ""Living in Chang'an as a Guest,"" continues the theme of friendship. The authenticity of this handscroll is not questioned in any of its seven inscriptions and colophons. The date that accompanies the artist's inscription, however, is equivalent either to 1595, when Wang was three years old, or to 1655, three years after his death.","Section 1
憶中園 (有引)

成都城外二里許有中園, 藩莊也, 阡連東南, 江帶左右, 衍在中也。附轄州縣三十餘治,每歲上巳期集駿賽會錦津時, 則王孫俠士, 金絡寶鏕, 琇充繪束, 罄控如龍, 而觀擁堵牆, 采喝雷電。又有花梨屏, 梅籹霞榭, 弦歌雜作, 月吐山更如狂岡, 念望五而止。大康沉沉, 誰醉思外展也。嘉會夢覺, 忽喪彼都, 人士宛結, 我心爰同。社友吳孟春坪、冷季、梅庵客窗憶及, 潛然涕下, 同志嘯歌, 不知所云。

蜀國相封三百秋, 土貢五色開梁州, 華陽松柏臥龍井, 中園寶玉金沙頭。年年春光搖上巳, 三十州縣誇錦里, 駿馬雕鞍約三千, 一夜行空驟雲至, 雲至霧曉梨花開, 雪屏梅帳簇莓苔, 江亭妓酒弦歌雜, 闐闐綺錯少城隈, 中有一疋兩疋龍, 蹄生雲霧掃春風, 千呼萬呼齊拍采, 天馬不與凡馬同, 幾見三月有十五, 江水長流山月空。記得辛酉尚留盛, 泗瀾錦水百花映, 鎖橋畔近千萬家, 家家叢竹醉異聖, 醉述賽馬抵家談, 同口龍媒無青燥, 火燐時焰金沙漵,  突遭匪茹屠馬賊, 錦關花竹痛江南, 江南花竹推有蜀, 滄浪歌聽溪綠。別經離亂三十年, 腸斷荒煙遙躑躅。君不問甲申以後張逆成都更慘傷, 人無孓遺士無粟, 沃野千里草迷天, 海田夢歸魂不足。客萍莫聚三月三, 新月入杯誰思酣, 春去又來五月五, 冬夜鄉愁夏日補。江、掌。

地闢天開存我輩, 東南西北皆身內, 黃河白日電影來, 那得由人執進退。今日相逢北邙山, 明日擁騎函谷關, 一日一夜數千里, 秦蜀塞霜凋容顏。吾友膽義不言苦, 從軍直入少城灣, 青燐時焰金沙漵, 明月孤瀠錦水班。十年生聚應沃野, 萬里題橋今司馬, 洛陽分乎休為嗟, 三萬六千日可賈, 樽前一語贈千古, 且遲岷山訪月戶, 君不見拯溺道情豈異人, 展季弦高可歷數。

In contrast, the camel that looms like a shadow directly behind her is rendered in soft, blurry ink washes. A phenomenon of the Cultural Revolution, barefoot doctors were physicians serving rural areas. Many were farmers or workers who had received rudimentary training before starting practice. An artist in favor of socialist realism, Huang Zhou developed a fascination with the working classes and ethnic minorities living in China’s northwestern border provinces such as Xinjiang, and his paintings often vividly captured the life and environment in the frontiers.

Such flasks were originally made for carrying water, like the canteens soldiers and hikers use. Several of the examples here have decorative loops recalling those by which a rope or carrying strap may have been attached. Functional pilgrim's flasks were made in several materials.

Several color combinations—with pigments applied either in underglaze or in colorful overglaze enamels—flourished through the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Multicolor, or “five colors” (wucai), decoration is a term applied to the combination of blue underglaze with three or more overglaze colors. The colors are applied in equal proportions; thus, no single color dominates and a balanced decoration is achieved. During the Ming dynasty, artists developed an unprecedented decorative scheme in which two or more colors were used in combination; this is sometimes called “three colors” (sancai) decoration. Pieces using this technique were produced during the reign of the Kangxi emperor (1662–1722) and are distinctive for their absence of red and their predominance of cooler colors: lavender, light yellow, and/or light green. One hallmark of Ming ceramics is the development of a stable, subtle marigold yellow. Two popular multicolor combination for yellow wares—red over yellow, and green over yellow—were developed during this time, the former employing a red overglaze on a yellow ground, and the latter a green enamel painted directly on a yellow ground.",,Ming dynasty (1368-1644),Ceramics,"H. 18 5/8 in x Diam. 13 7/8 in, H. 47.3 cm x Diam. 35.2 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60P1226,Stoneware with carved design and multicolor glazes,Northern China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/17175/preview,Lidded jar with a scene of celebrating longevity by Daoist Immortals

Certain ancient types among Song official productions (960 –1279)were continuously copied. Ming official factories never stopped experimenting with varieties of new glazes, strains, and decorative devices to maintain porcelain's dominance over other ceremonial materials. A group of tablewares from the Avery Brundage collection illustrates four types of monochrome glazes produced in the Ming imperial factories in Jingdezhen from the early fifteenth through the sixteenth centuries. The Yongle emperor chose the color white and Islamic metalwork–inspired forms to be used at altars and imperial temples. The fifteenth-century white glaze, soupy and smooth, is known as ""sweet white."" The dark blue glaze, favored by earlier Mongol rulers, was successfully reproduced during the Xuande period. Blue was often used in ritual celebrations on sacrificial altars. Eloquent names, such as ""gemstone blue"" and ""celestial blue,"" were documented. Yellow, viewed as a noble color, became fashionable in the late fifteenth century. This low-fire glaze could cover a previously fired white glaze for refiring, or coat a clay body for only one firing. The yellow wares presented to the Chenghua and Zhengde courts exhibit a delicate body and refined texture with sensitive color tone, winning the admirable description ""chicken fat."" The brown glaze resulted from an experiment in the Xuande reign, when official porcelain manufacturers attempted to re-create the brown glaze of a type of ancient Ding ware that had once been presented to the Northern Song court. On Ming imperial porcelain, brown glaze that glimmered on the surface with a shiny metallic luster was called ""purple gold,"" after the description for brown Song Ding ware.

These practices lost some of their importance with the breakdown of the Zhou government and ritual system. The subsequent social changes corresponded with the beginnings of the use of iron and other changes in technology, and resulted in an increase of wealth among a much broader segment of the population. These new patrons created a demand for luxury items in bronze, jade, lacquer, textile, and other materials. Items of personal adornment in bronze, which had been rare in earlier periods, were created in great numbers. Many were small in scale, elegant, and superbly crafted. Gilding, inlaying, and other decorative techniques also became more common and many items featured inlays of gold, silver, jade, and precious stones. All of these qualities are found in belt hooks, which were used to hang small objects or fasten elaborate belts around loose-fitting embroidered silk robes.

The fish is simply incised with round eyes, gills outlined by a pair of lines, a long fin on the back and two shorter fins on the belly, all are represented by dense parallel short lines. A perforation is placed on the upper gill. Not only did Shang jade fish vary in shapes, functions, and decorations on the body, but their compositional themes were manifold. The straight fish forms from the Fuhao tomb appear to have been used as knives and earpicks in addition to the traditional function as ornaments. [1] The depiction of fish was rendered as with round eyes worked by single or double outlines, a single line of fins on the back and two friezes of short fins on the belly, and a forked or straight ended tail. One or two perforations were executed as the indication of the mouth or tail ends. Western-Zhou jade carvers generally inherited the Shang's manner of depicting fish, as many straight-bodied fish have been unearthed from Western Zhou tombs. [2] (published: d'Argence 1977: 28) 1.

,,,,,,,Not on view,images_china/asian_china1125.jpg,,"To create this hook, the artisan used pale gray-green hetian jade with whitish mottling and gray veins, polished to a waxy shine. The piece is distinguished from most other hooks by its one short end curving almost parallel to the other, which is carved to depict a dragon's head. The short end has a tenon pierced horizontally with a hole. The dragon's head has a slit mouth with a small cavity and cloudlike whirls on the beard, eyebrows, and hair. Varied short bevel strokes and densely curved lines produce details. A red residue in the mouth and holes consists of remnants of applied cinnabar. Yang Boda, research fellow at the Palace Museum, Beijing, in his survey of the jade collection of the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco in 1996, dated this piece to the Ming period. A few months later, Mou Yongkang, archaeologist of the Zhejiang Institute of Archaeology, during a short visit to the museum, concluded that the piece was an earlier work. Archaeologists have found no other hooks with quite the same pierced end and tenon, apparently designed for stringing or fastening something to the hook. Generally, men wore belt hooks, and only occasionally were hooks found in female tombs. The earliest excavated belt hooks, dating to the Spring and Autumn Period (771–476 bce), were found in the Central Plains area and were made of metal. There is archaeological evidence that the single-hook form continued until the Han period, but evidence is lacking as yet of the use of a hook and buckle together in early periods. Three possible functions have been suggested for this piece: (1) as a woman's pendant in a shape borrowed from a belt hook; (2) as an ornament modified from an old hook; and (3) as a specially designed belt hook with holes for hanging objects. Any of these would have been fairly common in jade craft. The nicely proportioned dragon's head has a strongly archaic style. The cavities reveal a rather simple crafting process, and the horizontal slit on the mouth is not perfectly straight, signaling that it was made using a manual tool.",,Ming dynasty (1368-1644) or earlier,Jade And Stones,"H. 1 in x W. 1 1/2 in x D. 3/8 in, H. 2.5 cm x W. 3.8 cm x D. 0.7 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60J715,Nephrite,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/14947/preview,Hook with perforations

The head of the taotie has large eyes, horns, and a gaping mouth; the body at times has only one pair of legs. As the gong illustrates, in later periods of the Shang dynasty the taotie was joined by a wide range of dragons, birds, and other animals, both real and imaginary. What meaning did the taotie have? Some scholars believe that it evolved from decorative patterns and had no real meanings. Others argue that a motif as prominent as the taotie must have been central to the culture’s world view.

That is probably the case with this sword slide or guard. The decoration on the front surface is consistent with a late Warring States or early Western Han date. It features linked comma patterns and other curvilinear devices, some with fine parallel lines incised over them. Also typical of the period, the surface is highly polished. However, the back section of the piece is in an entirely different. It is crudely finished with only cursory lines incised to suggest a vague reference to the earlier designs. It is also far to round in shape to have served successfully as a sword slide. It has been suggested that this piece is a fragment that was re-cut sometime shortly after the end of the Han dynasty into a traditional shape. The exact date of the re-cutting cannot be precisely determined but it might be as early as the third or fourth century. The exact nature of the original piece is hard to determine. It was not much wider than its current form but must have been somewhat longer. At one end are the eyebrows, eyes, and the beginnings of the snout of a dragon. The piece must have been long enough to accommodate the remainder of the dragon and perhaps more. It was also fairly thick. This piece is cut from grayish tan Khotan jade with darker cloudy areas at one end. Both the level of finish and polish on the front side are very high. The back is very rough and is not polished. Staining and adhesions of iron imprinted with textile patterns on the back of this piece indicate that it served as a fitting for an iron sword when it was buried and that it was a treasured piece. 1.

As Rawson points out, these objects were fairly common in certain early to middle Neolithic cultures, but seem to have vanished during the late Neolithic, only to reappear some 1000 or more years later during the early Eastern Zhou (Rawson, p. 243). She also suggests that the Eastern Zhou examples were conscious copies of Neolithic prototypes, and that these earlier pieces had survived to serve as models. The exact function of these objects also remains somewhat of a mystery. Archaeological evidence indicates that the Neolithic jue was most commonly an earring. However, the Eastern Zhou version with its long profile and narrow opening could serve this function only in a very awkward fashion. The opening also makes it difficult to imagine how such a piece could function as a bead for suspending a pendant; any line passing through it would easily escape through the long slot. Rawson suggests that the flattened version of the jue was used in conjunction with a shroud in the changing burial practices of the Eastern Zhou period (Rawson, p. 243). This is consistent with the location of these objects in burials. It is possible that the more tubular version served a similar function. Much of the jade of this jue has been altered by burial and is cloudy white in color. However, there is an area on one side that is not altered and reveals the tan-colored stone from Khotan found in many Western Zhou pieces. The decoration consists of curvilinear patterns created by pairs of parallel lines and ending in a small circular motif. Small independent circles are also found between the larger motifs.

Particular flowers or combinations of birds and flowers were often chosen less for their intrinsic beauty than for their symbolic meaning. As a result, Ming and Qing artisans became successful in blending decorative motifs from multiple sources into a consistent, cohesive visual language. This language— utilizing birds, flowers, plants, and landscapes together with color symbolism—continued to evolve and expand during the Qing dynasty, reaching a pinnacle in the 1700s.

A kui dragonet creeps on the top, its upper body in openwork and its lower limbs clinging to the plate. The back of the plate is plain, with a rectangular slot off to one side. Jade sword pommels and guards emerged in the early Eastern Zhou period, while buckles and chapes did not appear until around 400 bce. Sword buckles have been unearthed mainly in the Central Plains, Liaoning, Hunan, Yunnan, and Guangdong. After the Han period, the term wei was used for a sword buckle, also known as a slide. A buckle would be attached vertically to the upper part of a scabbard, with the buckle's slot facing the scabbard. The slot may have been intended as a fingerhold, although recently it has been suggested that a belt might have been inserted through the slot so that the sword could be carried on a person's waist. A relief or line work dragonet, which always had a long, curving tail that split into two coiled floral ends, ornamented the scabbard buckles of Western Han nobles (Museum of the Western Han Tomb of the King of Nanyue 1991, plate 72; Institute of Archaeology 1980a, vol. 2, plate 64, fig. 5). Brownish pigments have been applied to this piece. The craftwork and the dragonet design led to a mistaken dating to the Han period.

The set unearthed from the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng has sixty-five bells, with the largest one more than five feet tall. Bronze ritual bells found in tombs were arranged in sets, called bianzhong. A complete set could include three types of bells, sorted in groups from large to small. The most common types of bells in the Eastern Zhou period (770–256 BCE) were yongzhong, which have a long columnar handle on the top, and niuzhong, which have a semicircular knob instead of a handle. Found less frequently, bozhong generally have loop handles, a flat bottom, and a rounder body. Bell sets with as many as sixty-five pieces, the largest more than five feet in height, have been discovered in Eastern Zhou-period aristocratic tombs.

They should be seen primarily as either presentation pieces or objects that served some role in court rituals or ceremonies. In order to create a piece of carved lacquer of this level of complexity, the inner wood core was usually strengthened with lacquer-impregnated cloth. Then several layers of lacquer mixed with very fine clay were applied to form a uniform surface, followed by multiple layers of lacquer. Each layer had to cure fully and then be lightly buffed before the next layer could be applied. In most cases a telltale line in a contrasting color of lacquer was applied in the first several layers. This served as a depth guide for the carver. In this example, alternate layers of black and red served this purpose. The base coat, which appears at the bottom of the most deeply carved areas, is red.

The influence of scholarly taste had its effect on virtually all aspects of artistic production, most obviously painting and calligraphy. Advances in the print industry allowed broad access to reproductions of pictorial imagery, which became pervasive in mediums such as ceramics, textiles, and lacquer. The popularity of landscape paintings and scenes from everyday life extended into all mediums. Especially popular at this time were how-to manuals that detailed the techniques of painting—methods for depicting the lines of garments and for types of dots and strokes in landscape elements. The use of such manuals by artists and artisans working in many mediums resulted in highly conventionalized brushwork and other formulaic styles.

Over the following centuries, Chinese potters experimented with lead-based glazes and added blue, white, and a number of other colors to their palette. At the peak of their development in the Tang dynasty, glazes were made in five or six colors. These colorful Tang-dynasty ceramics are known in Chinese as sancai, or three-color wares. The glazes were applied with little apparent regard for the natural coloration of the animal or object depicted, and sancai wares are among the few examples in Chinese ceramics that have the appearance of spontaneity. However, this appearance can be deceiving, as a range of devices, including the application of resists and the incising of patterns on the surface, were sometimes used to control the flow of the glaze.

Traveling monks carried ideas, as well as texts and probably small artworks, between India, Southeast Asia, and China. Certain symbols, motifs, and trends in artistic style show up all around the Buddhist world, having been transmitted by pious travelers. For instance, the Buddha is usually shown seated cross-legged. However, in the period from the 400s through the 800s, images like this one, showing him seated on a throne, with his legs downward, were produced from India to Japan and at many Buddhist sites in-between. The exact identity of buddhas seated in this way is sometimes not clear. In East Asia they are often identified as the buddha of the future, Maitreya. In Indonesia, some evidence suggests that they often represent a supreme buddha like Vairochana.

Particular flowers or combinations of birds and flowers were often chosen less for their intrinsic beauty than for their symbolic meaning. As a result, Ming and Qing artisans became successful in blending decorative motifs from multiple sources into a consistent, cohesive visual language. This language— utilizing birds, flowers, plants, and landscapes together with color symbolism—continued to evolve and expand during the Qing dynasty, reaching a pinnacle in the 1700s. Technological developments made possible the large variety of sizes, shapes, and decorative techniques of the objects in this case.

The set unearthed from the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng has sixty-five bells, with the largest one more than five feet tall. Bronze ritual bells found in tombs were arranged in sets, called bianzhong. A complete set could include three types of bells, sorted in groups from large to small. The most common types of bells in the Eastern Zhou period (770–256 BCE) were yongzhong, which have a long columnar handle on the top, and niuzhong, which have a semicircular knob instead of a handle. Found less frequently, bozhong generally have loop handles, a flat bottom, and a rounder body. Bell sets with as many as sixty-five pieces, the largest more than five feet in height, have been discovered in Eastern Zhou-period aristocratic tombs.

Objects often bore symbols of harmony, blessings, and wealth as a means of reaffirming the legitimacy of the reigning emperor and attracting blessings to the court. Technological developments in surface decoration led to a vast visual language of symbols that evoked specific meanings; these symbolic elements took precedence over shapes and glazes.

The popularity of landscape paintings and scenes from everyday life extended into all mediums. Especially popular at this time were how-to manuals that detailed the techniques of painting—methods for depicting the lines of garments and for types of dots and strokes in landscape elements.

Several color combinations—with pigments applied either in underglaze or in colorful overglaze enamels—flourished through the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Multicolor, or “five colors” (wucai), decoration is a term applied to the combination of blue underglaze with three or more overglaze colors. The colors are applied in equal proportions; thus, no single color dominates and a balanced decoration is achieved. During the Ming dynasty, artists developed an unprecedented decorative scheme in which two or more colors were used in combination; this is sometimes called “three colors” (sancai) decoration. Pieces using this technique were produced during the reign of the Kangxi emperor (1662–1722) and are distinctive for their absence of red and their predominance of cooler colors: lavender, light yellow, and/or light green. One hallmark of Ming ceramics is the development of a stable, subtle marigold yellow.

,,,,,,,Not on view,images_china/asian_china1478.jpg,,"Ritual and burial objects of some scale began to appear in increasing numbers during of the Warring States period and on into the Western Han. Most common among these was the bi . The reasons for this increase at least in part can be attributed to a combination of economic factors, greater access to material from Hetian (Khotan), and changes in funerary practices. Funerary paintings of the Western Han period depict the bi as part of an ensemble tied together with cords. Bi are shown on the two painted silk banners from tombs number I and III at Mawangdui, Changsha, with two dragons entwined through the central opening and with a triangular ornament suspended from the bi by a cord with tassels. A bi in the Seattle Art Museum similar to the example under discussion actually has discolored areas showing where such cords would have passed through it. It is thought that these ensembles were placed on top of coffins and played an important role in Han funerary practices. The hexagonal pattern, known as the rush or matting pattern in Chinese literature, is commonly found on jade bi of the Western Han period. It is created by a series of lines cut at angles. The first stages of creating the ""sprouting grain"" pattern may have been identical; thus this decoration is a simplified version of a more complex and time consuming earlier pattern. This again may suggest a change in attitude toward the objects created from jade and may also suggest that theywere intended only for burial. This piece is quite thin and is cut from a piece of yellowish Khotan jade. Unlike many thin-cut pieces from earlier periods, the two sides here are exactly parallel and even. This suggests some further advances in the saws used to cut the raw stone. There are two areas of significant staining and alteration of the stone and some suggestions of veining or flaws. The overall surface is mottled with areas of white. 1. Shang Zhitan, ""Mawangdui yihao Han mu 'feiyi'shishi"" (An Interpretation of the ""feiyi"" [painting] from the Han Tomb no.

,,,,Warring States period (approx. 475-221 BCE),,,Not on view,images_china/asian_china1481.jpg,,"Agate is relatively rare in burials of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods and seems to appear in a select group of objects. This rather odd shaped object is an example of one type of implement that seems to have been almost exclusively from this medium. Comparable to this piece is a pair from the late Spring and Autumn period tombs at Taiyuan in Shanxi province. Similar pieces have been found in Shandong. They are described as dragon-shaped ornaments, with the small protrusion along the bottom of the piece serving as the dragon's leg. The suspension hole drilled in the center of these pieces would indicate that they served as part of a pendant. They have been found in coffins near the skeleton, most often close to the legs or even the feet of the deceased, suggesting that they were suspended low on the body. Similar to jade, agate is a hard stone that cannot be easily carved; however, it does not have jade's fibrous structure and is actually quite brittle and often filled with veins or flaws. Thus it is quite difficult to create any detail on the surface of an agate object. The examples found in Chinese tombs of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods are often relatively simple shapes with high polishes, little if any surface decoration and sharply defined edges. Agate is much more translucent than jade, and that is certainly the case with this piece which approaches transparency. The stone has a very slight brown tinge with fine cloud-like areas dispersed throughout. 1. Fung, p. 180 2. Zhongguo Yuqi Chuanji , vol 3, p. 28, plate 44 3. Kaogu , 1964, no. 2, p. 135, no. 10 4.

There is an indentation under the front leg. Among excavated jades, mantis are not seen before the late Shang period. The published jade mantis from the Fuhao tomb demonstrates a columnar body with a waisted neck and a round head resting on disproportionally large, winding legs. 1 Coincident with other good contemporary jade work, double-outlines and shallow-relief are used on the piece. Notably grooves are carved beneath the legs, between which two perforations are designed for hanging or tying. Another extant piece at the Beijing Palace Museum, dated to the Shang, although its simple artistic style is close to that of the AAM piece, is executed in the same design with grooves and a hole under the legs as the Fuhao piece. 2 A rare specimen among Shang jade, this mantis bears special interest because of its simplicity. 1.

,,,,Warring States period (475–221 BCE),,,On view,images_china/asian_china1483.jpg,,"Objects of Personal Adornment from the Eastern Zhou and Western Han Periods Hereditary practices during the early parts of the Zhou dynasty had focused much of the wealth and power in the hands of a small aristocracy. These practices lost some of their importance with the breakdown of the Zhou government and ritual system. The subsequent social changes corresponded with the beginnings of the use of iron and other changes in technology, and resulted in an increase of wealth among a much broader segment of the population. These new patrons created a demand for luxury items in bronze, jade, lacquer, textile, and other materials. Items of personal adornment in bronze, which had been rare in earlier periods, were created in great numbers. Many were small in scale, elegant, and superbly crafted. Gilding, inlaying, and other decorative techniques also became more common and many items featured inlays of gold, silver, jade, and precious stones. All of these qualities are found in belt hooks, which were used to hang small objects or fasten elaborate belts around loose-fitting embroidered silk robes. From the objects in this case you will see that bronze, iron, and jade served as bases for these belt hooks. Iron corrodes much more easily than bronze, and few iron pieces have survived from this early period.",,,Jade And Stones,"H. 1 1/2 in x W. 1 5/8 in x D. 1/16 in, H. 3.8 cm x W. 4.1 cm x D. .16 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60J815,Nephrite,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/15105/preview,Bird-shaped hairpin

This cow turning its head backward has a rather flat body; only a few lines were used to indicate the horn and legs. The careful craftsmanship was focused on the narrow edge where deep grooves depict the tail and hooves. Two cone-shaped holes, drilled from above and below the front leg, are joined; inside them traces of cinnabar remain from an earlier immersion. One of the creative ideas of Shang jade carvers was the portrayal of animals turning their heads backward, as witnessed by cows, deer, and dogs found in the Fuhao tomb. 1 It is likely that such a design differed from normal formations and was probably worked by skillful jade masters for a Shang noble. The perforation of the two nostrils on the Fuhao cow indicates that the Shang people were able to till fields with cows pulled by means of a nosering. This thematic composition became the persistent model in jade art and was followed for centuries. 1. Zhongguo yuqi quanji (Collection of Chinese Jades), Hebei meishu chubanshe 1993 vol.

The use of green jade and the design of a rather elongated body attempted to follow a Western Zhou style. Western Zhou fish pendants were relaxed, simple, and naïve (Liu 1996, plates 12, 27, 36, 61, 72–76). They had straightforward shapes, with no exaggerated contours. Loosely arranged short strokes depicted fins, and the fish generally did not have slits or pointed notches for features.

This painting portrays a man gazing pensively into the mist as if from a mountain pavilion. Some pathways fade into a forest and the roof of a cottage, while others lead to a river where a boat is anchored. Scenes depicting idealized environments like this are common in traditional painting throughout Chinese history. Such portrayals symbolize both the veneration of nature and the human journey toward spiritual cultivation. Zou Zhe belonged to a group of seventeenth-century artists from the Jinling (Nanjing) area in southeastern China. They challenged the court academy of painters by developing their own styles, which they used in correspondence and other personal pursuits. Some of these artists, including Zou Zhe, explored themes related to Tao Yuanming, who evoked for them the spiritual freedom of a noble soul. Painters have used both monochrome ink and the multicolor “blue-green”
style of ink to capture the idyllic secluded paradise described in verse by Tao
Yuanming. Artist Zou Zhe rendered this series of works in color; look for his
monochrome ink painting on view in this gallery. The six scenes are, from right
to left: Observing the water. Having stepped from their boat anchored below, two educated
elites sit in the corridor of a thatched house. Here, the artist concentrates

The glazes were applied with little apparent regard for the natural coloration of the animal or object depicted, and sancai wares are among the few examples in Chinese ceramics that have the appearance of spontaneity. However, this appearance can be deceiving, as a range of devices, including the application of resists and the incising of patterns on the surface, were sometimes used to control the flow of the glaze.

Sometimes the vessels were finished with a final wheel-throwing.

Here it has been carved from an opaque, grayish-green jade with brownish flaws; spots have been carved into the stone and filled with yellowish dyes. The beast turns its upper body slightly toward one side. The two forepaws are joined,forming an openwork space between them and the chest. The facial features are shown in round relief, while the spine is a raised cylinder. The bifurcated tail is coiled on the hip. The specific beast is difficult to identify from general descriptions in classical texts of the Han to Tang periods. It has been called suanni, tianlu, bixie, baize, or kilin (qilin). What distinguishes these various creatures is uncertain. Han documents recorded that tianlu with one horn and bixie with two horns appeared in pairs on two sides of a tomb; modern historians refer to both as animals with wings. Baize, the spirit of all mythic deities, was said to be a creature thatonly a great emperor could encounter in the east paradise. Suanni, who could run thousands of miles in a day, had the supernatural ability to understand the universe. Kilin (qilin) (the male is called ki, or qi, and the female lin) had a single horn, a deer's body, a cow's tail, and a wolf's claws. Early jade crouching beasts like this example are commonly found in museums and are generally attributed to the Song period (Palace Museum, Beijing 1995, vol. 41, plate 57).

Its much simplified form is smoothed, with an oval head, two folded wings depicted by curved grooves stretching from the sides of the chest downward, and crescent-shaped legs slightly raised on the sides of the belly. The short beak is emphasized by the soft relief throughout the middle section of the head. There are no sharp edges nor refined lines to delineate the bird's features; rather, a careful polishing of the entire body and a characteristically streamlined form seem to have been the craftsman's pursuit. The bird image in Chinese art is an ancient one. Produced at the same time as painted representations, three-dimensional birds sculpted from clay and stone go back to the neolithic period, as witnessed in the Hemudu culture along the lower valley of the Yangzi River (5000-3000 BC) and in the slightly later Dawenkou culture (4300-2400 BC), whose bird-and-sun motif carved on ivory is thought to be the source of the primitive belief that was passed over to the Liangzhu culture, in the border zone of Zhejiang and Jiangsu (3400-2200 BC). In the northeast, around Liaoning and Inner Mongolia, the Hongshan culture (3500-2200 BC) is well known for having produced jade pendants in the shape of birds with spread wings. Scholars question whether the distribution of jade birds along the eastern coastal zone was related to the sun-bird motif of the Liangzhu culture or to the ancient myth of wild-birdmen which originated in the eastern region.

The body is embellished with transformed clouds consisting of C-, S-, and comma-shaped designs. To enhance the shallow relief, the jade worker has ground off the edges of patterns and used incised intaglio lines and deep grooves. The compositional theme mimics that of an Eastern Zhou jade quite closely. However, several discrepancies are apparent. First, the dragonet is incorrectly proportioned—both too short and too high, with uncharacteristic protrusions around the mouth and the lower belly. The C shape with a hook in the middle is an idea more recent than the Eastern Zhou period. The overlapping of two Cs and two commas is a misinterpretation of two motifs used separately on Warring States jade.

Its horns, eyes, ears, and legs in relief are symmetrically arranged on the body. The semi-gaping mouth is exposed with a deep indentation which is connected to a pilot hole below. The compact body resting on four legs is robust. Shallow-relief and grooves are used to achieve for a simple representation. Animals sculpted in jade were far more common during the Shang period than during the prehistoric era. The superstitious belief of the Shang people in divine animals was an ancient tradition that prevailed in the eastern region in the neolithic period. Wearing animal pendants seems to have been inspired by the belief that the essence of jade would convey the power of divine animals to the live human beings who wore the jade. Dragons, tigers, turtles, bird, and fish were of particular concern to the Shang people. Quite a lot of jade tigers in three-dimensional or plaque form have been unearthed from Shang tombs in Henan. 1 One or two holes are pierced in the back, the mouth, or the tail. Single and double lines in intaglio are employed for features and cloud patterns on the body. The three-dimensional tigers without holes, however, are different from plaque pendants in function. They are thought to have been protective creatures buried in tombs. (published: d'Argence 1977: 30) 1. Zhongguo yuqi quanji (Collection of Chinese Jade) Hebei meishu chubanshe 1993 vol.

,,approx. 1900-1949,,,,,Not on view,images_china/asian_china1765.jpg,,"In highly polished white jade, a small plaque was created with a hole running vertically all the way through the cross section, from the flat top to the bottom. Both sides show the torso of a dancer. There are three pairs of openwork areas: beside the top of the head, at the ears, and at the waist. The figure lifts the left arm across the top of the head, and holds a draping cloth bundle that seems to protrude from the right ear. Straight, triangular, and incised intaglio lines depict details. The piece was previously identified as a Warring States work from the fifth to the third century bce (d'Argencé 1972, 52–53, plate 19). Three-dimensional human figures and torsos were sculpted from jade as early as the Neolithic period and were executed in thin plaques in the Bronze Age. Archaeological finds of Western Zhou human plaques have thicknesses from 0.3 to 0.6 cm (0.1 to 0.2 in.) (Liu 1996, plates 141–44, 230–31; Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 2, plates 219–20). By the Eastern Zhou period, the thickness of human plaques was reduced; still, human figures in rectangular plaque forms were rarely seen until they reemerged in the Han period (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 4, plates 157–58). All Han jade dancer plaques were represented in a period style: The dancer was standing, one arm lifted and across the head, with a long sleeve draping down over the right shoulder. No fingers were exposed. These were tiny, thin statuettes, and the artisans economically incised simple lines to depict the figures abstractly. Holes were always pierced from both sides at the center of the top and the lower portion. No documented piece was pierced vertically through the cross-section. This is clearly a newer piece. The material used and the high polish are both recent. Aside from its unusual position, the hole was drilled by an electric machine. The half rather than full body view and the exposed hand are representations not used in archaic pieces.",,Qing dynasty (1644-1911) or Republic period (1912-1949),Jade And Stones,"H. 1 1/16 in x W. 3/4 in x D. 1/8 in, H. 2.7 cm x W. 1.9 cm x D. .32 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60J766,Nephrite,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/15024/preview,Dancer pendant

The large central opening contrasts with the small hole framed in the tail on one side and the opened mouth on the other side. The spine ridge is incised with a row of cross patterns; the two faces of the body depict facial details and shield-shaped scales. Incised refined lines, double-outlined wide grooves, and raised line work are characteristic of the jade work of the period. As the mythic symbol of supreme, the dragon image was dominant in Shang art. Although jade dragons from Shang sites in Henan are worked in complete circles, semicircles, crescents, slightly curved, and elongated forms, 1 the form of this ring with the lower support is rare. Those excavated jade dragons with at least one perforation, and some with one or two indentations, seem to have served as components of ornaments or pendants. Shield-, cloud-, triangle-, and cross-patterns on jade dragons are often represented by double outlines. A new form on jade sculpture is seen in the openings which mostly depict the mouth of the dragon and display serrated floral panels in profile, the result of intermittent sawing. In this case, the technique of grinding patterns and sawing holes are of much help for identification. (published: d'Argence 1977: 24) 1.

Early examples were simple in form, but by the late 1700s medicinal bottles had evolved into beautiful works of art that were viewed as collectors’ items. The appeal of these bottles to collectors continues to this day. Snuff bottles are a reflection of Chinese art in miniature form.

Among the more ingenious works of Jiading artisans were sliced bamboo armrests and plaques. The front face of these works was always polished and carved with decorations; the reverse was often left natural, revealing the raised joints. Many master artisans who practiced bamboo, wood, and jade carving experimented on jade with designs created for bamboo, and soon bamboo joints became beloved elements in jade.

Usually Shang pan have three irregularly shaped perforations where the bowl and feet meet. Late Zhou texts refer to pan as vessels used for ablutions, and the aquatic nature of their main ornamental schemes clearly indicates that they were meant to hold water. These unusual designs and the special cursive way in which they are rendered illustrate a surprising freshness of attitude, a sort of popular vein which is usually absent from all other categories of vessels. The exterior decoration of this pan is somewhat less commonplace than that of the preceding vessel [B60 B1001]. On the bowl itself, a narrow six-panel band contains six dragons confronted, two by two. In front of their spiraling tails and underneath their bellies is a rare motif consisting of a circle with six or seven circular indentations. The foot band is more prosaically decorated with three panels of confronted, winged dragons forming taotie masks with high, sharp central ridges. While the rim is free of any ornament, the inside walls display the same kind of procession mentioned above. The lower part of the walls and the bottom of the bowl are incised with a coiled, snake-like creature whose head is that of a taotie with bottle-shaped horns and large, dome-shaped, protruding eyes, as well as detached nostrils and whiskers. The body of the monster is made of two external strips with I and T-shaped scores (just like typical flanges) and of five strips with scale motifs alternating with plain areas. The most interesting and also the most unexpected aspect of the decor of the bowl taken as a whole is that it presents an unusual admixture of almost casual, perfunctory elements and very minute details.

The latter motif illustrates a more advanced stage in the calligraphic trend mentioned in connection with the preceding plate. In addition to two continuous friezes of stepped wave bands, the tall hu (back left, B60B1005) has two lug handles with central ridges.

Several color combinations—with pigments applied either in underglaze or in colorful overglaze enamels—flourished through the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Multicolor, or “five colors” (wucai), decoration is a term applied to the combination of blue underglaze with three or more overglaze colors. The colors are applied in equal proportions; thus, no single color dominates and a balanced decoration is achieved. During the Ming dynasty, artists developed an unprecedented decorative scheme in which two or more colors were used in combination; this is sometimes called “three colors” (sancai) decoration. Pieces using this technique were produced during the reign of the Kangxi emperor (1662–1722) and are distinctive for their absence of red and their predominance of cooler colors: lavender, light yellow, and/or light green. One hallmark of Ming ceramics is the development of a stable, subtle marigold yellow. Two popular multicolor combination for yellow wares—red over yellow, and green over yellow—were developed during this time, the former employing a red overglaze on a yellow ground, and the latter a green enamel painted directly on a yellow ground.",,Ming dynasty (1368-1644) or Qing dynasty (1644-1911),Ceramics,"H. 18 1/2 in x W. 6 1/2 in x D. 5 1/8 in, H. 47.1 cm x W. 16.5 cm x D. 13.1 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60P295,Earthenware with molded and carved decoration and three-color glaze,Northern China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/16687/preview,Ridge tile with statue of an arhat (luohan)

Their social interactions and activities had acquainted them with the paintings of old masters from the Song to Yuan dynasties (tenth to fourteenth centuries). The young Shen Zhou initially established himself in the prevailing Song styles. He quickly gained enough confidence in his brush skills to paint landscapes on small paper or silk. According to the notation he attached to the end of this scroll, Shen thought a small painting required an intense, sensitive, and delicate execution. In contrast, the brushwork in a large composition could be free-handed loosely and spontaneously, which indeed was relatively easier. Shen concluded, when looking at a small piece like this one, that viewers should imagine a scene that was twice as large.","Inscription 題跋一（卷後另纸自題）：小卷筆須約束，要全繊巧，非大軸廣幀，放筆爛漫，信

The semi-abstract picture not only encapsulates the charm of Chinese classical gardens but also reflects the artist’s idea that painting from nature is “not merely sketching shapes but perceiving forms. . . The main point is to bring out a sense of life.” Wu highlights the rhythmic beauty of curved rooflines extending out into the distance, with black tiles dancing across a white background. At the central courtyard, a blossoming wisteria tree adds spots of blue, representing “the vigor of spring’s radiance.” Wu was one of the most influential Chinese artists of his generation. He studied Chinese and Western painting under Pan Tianshou (1897–1971) and Lin Fengmian (1900–1991) at the Hangzhou Art Academy in the late 1930s and early 1940s. In 1947, Wu followed in Lin’s footsteps, receiving a government grant to study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he became fascinated with modernist artistic currents. He returned to China brimming with enthusiasm for Western art, especially the works of the Post-Impressionists, and advocated for the modernization of Chinese painting. During the Cultural Revolution, Wu was sent to labor and re-education camps and his paintings were destroyed. But he returned to prolific art-making in the late 1970s, and traveled frequently to depict the scenes of old water towns and classical gardens in Jiangnan. He also openly advocated for the beauty of abstraction and color and stayed active as both a painter and a theorist until his death at age 90. In June 1989, Wu visited San Francisco and viewed his solo exhibition here. To commemorate the occasion he added an inscription, which reads: “Delighted to see my old work.

The Han bears have a rectangular indent for mounting a vessel on the neck (Xuzhou Museum 1984, 36, fig. 62). Han bears, like other artifacts, had distinctive features rooted in the style of the period. Later reproductions of bears were always modeled after illustrations but were embellished with features reflecting current fashions. This bear's menacing expression and detailed features, such as the leaf-shaped incision on the forehead and the fuzzy tail , were absolutely contrary to Han artistic concepts. Furthermore, the piece of jade is newer than material from the Han dynasty, and the brown areas around the ears and the shallow round tray have been dyed.",,Qing dynasty (1644-1911) or Republic period (1912-1949),Jade And Stones,"H. 3 in x W. 3 in x D. 1 3/4 in, H. 7.6 cm x W. 7.6 cm x D. 4.4 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B65J2,Nephrite,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/22318/preview,Bear lamp

The ancient character she, used for an archer's ring, the prototype of this form, is composed of two radicals, the left representing leather and the right, a roundel, shares the pronunciation of the word for ""shooting."" Ancient archers' rings were leather wrapped around the thumb that drew the bowstring back to shoot an arrow. Early examples made of jade, bone, or horn were wider at one opening than at the other and often had two holes for fastening them to the finger. The fastening is shown in the earliest jade archer's ring discovered in a late Shang tomb in Henan (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 2, plate 111). Very soon jade rings were being produced in many forms and decorated with elaborate motifs. Modern scholars believe that they were too splendid to have been used and that perhaps they functioned as personal ornaments. No archaeological evidence has been found of jade rings from the Tang through the Yuan period. In the Ming period, jade rings were created in two new types. One was a straight-walled band with a rectangular setting on the top(Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plate 218). The other was a slit ring with a top setting inlaid with jade on a gold or silver shank (Shanghai Museum 1985, 541; Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plate 218). Both developed rapidly in varied intricate forms during the Qing period. Thick-walled thumb rings like the one shown here were a modified version of ancient archer rings preserved by the nomadic Manchus, who loved hunting on horseback. Whether such rings were made of jade, gemstone, ceramic, or metal, Manchu noblemen wore them on their right or both thumbs for display.",,Qing dynasty (1644-1911),Jade And Stones,"H. 1 1/8 in x Diam. 1 3/8 in x  Diam. opening 3/4 in, H. 2.86 cm x Diam. 3.49 cm x Diam. opening 1.91 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B62J36,Jadeite,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/20664/preview,Thumb ring

,,approx. 1500-1200 BCE,,,,,On view,images_china/asian_china2109.jpg,,"The Evolution of Bronze Shapes and Designs Changes in the design and decoration of early Bronze Age vessels can be seen as a series of experiments with the new material of bronze and the new technology of casting. The earliest Chinese metal vessels were created by hammering bronze into the desired shapes. The bodies of these vessels tend to be thin and their profiles exaggerated versions of earlier ceramic vessels. Later, artisans developed the technology to cast vessels by pouring the molten metal into molds. The earliest bronze vessels probably borrowed their shapes from ceramic prototypes of the late Neolithic period. Due to the nature of the material, most ceramic forms had thick bodies, rounded profiles, and few, if any, surface protrusions. This influence can be seen in the legs and overall profile of the bronze. Changes in bronze vessel forms from these rather awkward beginnings indicate their creators’ growing familiarity with the unique characteristics of the clay-mold casting process. While surface decoration became quite complex, most bronze forms remained relatively simple—either curved or square—to facilitate the release of the mold pieces. Three-dimensional additions, such as elaborate handles or functional parts of vessels, were often precast and attached to the body by one of two complicated processes. In addition to the thin band of decoration on the body of this vessel, a human mask with eyes in relief and a wideopen mouth decorates the top.",,Shang dynasty (approx. 1600-1050 BCE),Metal Arts,"H. 8 3/4 in x W. 6 in x D. 5 1/2 in, H. 22.9 cm x W. 15.2 cm x D. 14 in",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60B53,Bronze,"Henan province, China",Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/54935/preview,Ritual wine vessel (lihe)

There were three main categories: vessels for food, vessels for wine, and (in far fewer numbers) vessels for water. The most common food appears to have been a stew or gruel, and food vessels often had bowl-like bodies. The food was removed from the vessel with a ladle. Wine was served warm, and many wine vessels had relatively long legs so they could be placed over a fire. Spouts were also required for pouring the wine into cups. The awkward relationship between the usual three legs and two spouts was one of the challenges for the designers of these vessels. Water was apparently used for ritual cleansing, and most water vessels had relatively flat bottoms and low rims.",,Shang dynasty (approx. 1600-1050 BCE) or Western Zhou period (approx. 1050-771 BCE),Metal Arts,"H. 6 1/2 in x W. 13 1/4 in x Diam. 8 7/8 in, H. 16.5 cm x W. 33.7 cm x Diam. 22.5 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60B116,Bronze,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/58031/preview,Ritual food vessel (gui)

These practices lost some of their importance with the breakdown of the Zhou government and ritual system. The subsequent social changes corresponded with the beginnings of the use of iron and other changes in technology, and resulted in an increase of wealth among a much broader segment of the population. These new patrons created a demand for luxury items in bronze, jade, lacquer, textile, and other materials. Items of personal adornment in bronze, which had been rare in earlier periods, were created in great numbers. Many were small in scale, elegant, and superbly crafted. Gilding, inlaying, and other decorative techniques also became more common and many items featured inlays of gold, silver, jade, and precious stones. All of these qualities are found in belt hooks, which were used to hang small objects or fasten elaborate belts around loose-fitting embroidered silk robes.

The backdrop in the shape of a flaming mandorla (body halo) is incised with a variety of iconography, from Buddhist lotus petals, lions, and meditating buddhas, to heavenly birds and dancers carrying censers common to Daoism and the practice of ancestor worship. The base of the stele shows images of six major donors wearing elaborate clothing. The back of the stele depicts a debating scene probably from the VimalakirtiNirdesha sutra and identifies fifty-six donors arranged in rows with each one’s name, a pre-Buddhist practice. These donors are mainly from the Zhao family, plus several lay devotees and members of the Buddhist hierarchy. The nearby placard provides more details about the iconography and imagery on the stele, and transcribes the inscription, which dates the work to 533. Stele of a buddha and two bodhisattvas Each element of this stele has a particular meaning and contributes to the overall content of the piece. The main image is of a buddha attended by two bodhisattvas. The mandorla (body halo) behind them is divided into five different sections. The section nearest the buddha’s head contains lotus petals. The next section outward shows seven buddhas of the past. The top portion of the third section shows a dwarflike earth spirit supporting an incense burner. Each of the two flying heavenly beings hovering above and flanking the incense burner holds an oversized lotus bud. Below them are two heavenly beings playing musical instruments. Lotus pedestals support two more heavenly beings below—the right figure holds an incense burner and a dish of offerings, while the other holds an oversized lotus bud and an incense burner. The scarves of the heavenly beings billow among flowers and tendrils. The pointed portion above this band of heavenly beings contains a meditating buddha on a lotus throne. He is flanked by two more heavenly beings. The outermost section of the mandorla is incised with a close-knit pattern of flames. The base of the stele is incised with images of six donors under canopies wearing elaborate clothing showing their high positions. They stand facing the middle, which is ornamented with a figure bearing an incense burner. The donors’ names are inscribed, most of them from the Zhao family. The back contains fifty-six donor figures, their names—again, mostly members of the Zhao family as well as other devotees and members of the Buddhist hierarchy—and a long inscription giving the date of 533. The legible portions of the inscription read: [In 533] four lay devotees, Zhao Jianxi, Zhao [??], Zhao Wenyin, and Zhao Hongxian, because of their illustrious meritmaking activities from their birth to their death, heaven’s blessings are bestowed on them. For many years their grandfather [?]ying has been well known. He was the leader across the four seas, his influence spread widely, and he was renowned. Therefore, he was able to overcome the three ignorance. . . . All members of Buddhist societies know the three treasures are the best path [to pursuing and] achieving a state of purity. . . . Therefore, if one is donating one’s own funds to make an image, then the merit from the image will be great and [one will] become true Buddhist believers. . . . Bodhisattvas flank the sides, heavenly beings touch the sky, and newborns emerge from lotus flowers in paradise. . . [wish that] all sentient beings will attain [buddhahood] simultaneously.","The floral motifs in the two areas between the Buddha and the two Bodhisattvas are incised in very low relief.  They consist of lotus leaves and lotus pods with petals attached, all growing out from behind the lions.

These donors are dressed in elaborate costumes and shown under canopies, which might be an indication of their high status.  The area between the niches is inscribed with legends giving the names of the donors, who mainly from the Zhao family.

The section below the central scene shows an earth spirit bearing an incense burner and also includes two more scenes.  The one on the right might represent the monk Sariputra with the heavenly maid, while the scene on the left is unidentified.

Keeping track of who is who is a challenge even for the most dedicated fan. Most popular print depictions of Chinese opera fall into one of two categories: either showing the actors in full stage costume in a landscape or architectural setting or as they would appear on a stage traditionally set with minimal props. As the popularity of the theater grew beginning in the early 1800s, production of theatrical prints also surged. Popular prints became an important part of folk tradition nearly a thousand years ago, and they remain so today. These prints are used for residential decoration and viewing pleasure, and can be purchased throughout the year. Varied in subject, color, and format, the prints are often glued on doors, windows, walls, pillars, furniture, and any place outdoors around the house. Celebratory themes and images pictured on the prints bear wishes for a happy New Year, a long life, health, fortune, continuation of the family line, and protections against evil-many of the prominent themes embedded in symbols on Chinese art. Popular prints were made either using woodblock printing or using offset lithography, a technique that largely replaced woodblock printing from the early twentieth century onward. Derived from lithography, the offset process involves three cylinders: 1. The artist creates the image on the plate cylinder as he or she would like it to appear in print (that is, a positive image). 2. The image is transferred to the rubber offset cylinder as a negative. 3. Paper is fed between the offset cylinder and the impression cylinder, which presses the image onto the paper and results in a positive print.",,,Prints And Drawings,Image: H. 13 1/2 in × W. 18 3/4 in (34.3 cm × 47.6 cm) Overall: H. 17 1/16 in × W. 21 5/8 in (43.3 cm × 54.9 cm),Bequest of John Gutmann,,2010.186,"Offset lithograph, ink and colors on paper",China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/9962/preview,Theatrical scene

Heading up to a tea plantation, the five carry with them various implements, woven baskets, triangle and square sieves, and bamboo strips. The women have wrapped their heads with cloth. The contrast between shadows and bright areas in their exposed skin indicates the peak sunlight of midday. The viewer is drawn to a depiction of distinct individuals whose informal attire and energetic body language show them to be a collaborative team. The details of the setting, with wildflowers lined up along the sloping hills, two cows parallel and opposite to the women, and horizontal rivers far in the distance, create an everyday world that is complex and multidimensional. Zhang Xiaochun is one of the few artists from southern China who practices the waste-block method. The technique involves creating multicolor prints with only one woodblock, whose surface becomes useless and unprintable once the artwork is complete. Zhang employed the reduction block process to build gradient hues of brown, yellow, red, white, ochre, and black, capturing some of the effects of the light and heat typical of the women’s home province.",,,Prints And Drawings,"H. 26 in x W. 38 in, H. 66.0 cm x W. 96.5 cm",Acquisition made possible by David and Linda Lei,,2008.61,"Waste woodblock print, oil-based inks on paper",,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/61348/preview,Scorching Sun

Besides clearing one’s sinuses, snuff was also believed to relieve headaches, and by the early nineteenth century its inhalation had become a widespread practice in China. Early examples were simple in form, but by the late 1700s medicinal bottles had evolved into beautiful works of art that were viewed as collectors’ items. The appeal of these bottles to collectors continues to this day. Snuff bottles are a reflection of Chinese art in miniature form.

The squared hook shaped like a dragon in relief fits perfectly through a slot on the buckle. The base of thehook has a round stud; the buckle has an oval hole on one side and an elliptical stud on its base. A contorted dragonet carrying a floral branch in its mouth is crafted in openwork relief on the tops of the two facing squares. The line work of the details is remarkable in its refined incisions and deep grooves. Buckles developed at the same time as belt hooks, from an early Han style with a fixed or movable prong. The movable prong, attached to one side of a round, square, or irregular frame, became the standard form throughout history. Buckles with only an open frame on one side, and no prong, were a later version. The earliest jade buckles with no prong have been discovered not in Han but in early Ming tombs (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plate 199). Several jade buckles with round frames now in the Palace Museum, Beijing, collection have been attributed to the Song, the Jin, and the Yuan periods (960–1368) (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plates 79, 80, 158–59). Among these, two sets, each consisting of a hook and a buckle with an opening, were identified as Yuan belt sets (Palace Museum, Beijing 1995, vol. 42, plates 71, 72, 74, 138, 145). The dragon's head was functional, not just decorative; it hooked directly into the opening on the buckle. The wearer could attach a belt onto the studs on both the hook and the buckle, so no prong was needed. The combination of a soft waxy polish on the exterior and a rather rough interior on the openwork reveal this as a copy of a Yuan style. The fluent carving and smooth finish on the outer surface of the relief were most likely done in the 1700s.",,"Qing dynasty (1644-1911), Reign of the Qianlong emperor (1736-1795)",Jade And Stones,"H. 3/4 in x W. 4 3/16 in x D. 2 1/8 in, H. 1.9 cm x W. 10.6 cm x D. 5.4 cm",Gift of R.W.

A question was directed to an ancestor by applying a hot poker to these holes to make the surface crack. A specialist, usually a king or a member of a ruling family, would then read the appearance of the cracks to obtain the ancestor’s response. Both the question—in positive and negative forms—and the results were written on the surface of the oracle bone.

Along with the bird, the hare is frequently found as a subject for pendant plaques during the Western Zhou dynasty; it is rarely, if ever found in jades of the Shang dynasty. In later times the hare became associated with the moon and the elixir of immortality. It is difficult to say if that iconography had developed as early as the Western Zhou, but the frequent appearance of this animal in the arts of the period does suggest an increasing importance in Zhou culture. This piece is a flat silhouette with minimal surface ornamentation. Details are limited to a large circular eye, long ear, and the legs and feet. The points of attachment on this hare pendant indicate it was suspended from its nose. It would perhaps have joined a series of other hares along with beads and other pieces to form a complete necklace or other form of personal ornamentation. There is an uncompleted perforation on one side of the lower part of the animal's body. Like the cormorant discussed above, this rabbit is cut from a tan jade of a type that is generally associated with sources in Khotan. Some discoloration has occurred in burial and one side is matte and opaque. The other side was less affected and has a greater degree of gloss and translucence.

The holes cut under the beaks of the bird and one on the side indicate that this piece functioned as part of a pendant. The central hole is outlined by a slightly raised area except for an area directly at the bottom. From there a small, undecorated section continues to the lowest area on the piece. This suggests a wider piece of material, perhaps a ribbon, was suspended from this central hole. The surface decoration on the piece is rather cursory, consisting of little more than shallowly incised parallel lines making up a series of curves and volutes. The lines themselves are rough and unfinished, perhaps suggesting a piece of secondary importance or of provincial manufacture. The piece is thinly cut from a piece of very light yellow Khotan jade. The stone is of decent quality with some darker inclusions, and some cloudy areas. Despite the unfinished appearance of the decoration, the surface is highly polished.

A type of bronze belt hook with a shovel-shaped handle appeared in Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, and Shaanxi during the Eastern Zhou period. The shape was particularly favored by the Lu and Jin states, but its historic development has not been thoroughly studied. The head of a duck or a beast formed the hook. Some handle tops were plain; others were decorated with relief or inlay depicting birds, dragons, monster masks, or transformed clouds (Wang 1985, 283, fig. 9). Two published jade pieces were designed after metal works. A piece from Henan, dated to the late Spring and Autumn Period, bears stylized dragon and cloud designs.

The dorsal fins are divided into four sections, each with a wider and a narrower notch. The caudal fins are separated into two sets of short, parallel lines. One perforation was drilled from two sides at the eye. Fish pendants proliferated among the Shang and the Western Zhou inhabitants of the Central Plains and the northwest (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 2, plates 96, 115, 128). They became standardized in simple forms with a straight or curved body, the fins incised with short vertical strokes. The outer contour of the fish is simple and streamlined; only after the Spring and Autumn Period did a few notches appear on the edges to accent the depiction of the mouth and the lower jaw (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 2, plates 8–9). With a few circular exceptions, Shang and Zhou fish had no horizontal lines along the length of the body. One hole was drilled at the head, and one or two at the tail.

A fascinating study of changes in fashion and ideals of feminine beauty can be made by examining these tomb models. The human figurines in these tombs were arranged in a definite hierarchy. Models of servants and support staff were arranged along the floors and niches. Images of the deceased and his or her peers, as well as admired historical personalities and divine beings, were painted, carved in stone, or impressed in the clay tiles that made up the sarcophagus and the walls of the tomb chamber.

Clusters of people gathering around food stalls enjoy a late-night dinner. Others walk on the stone steps, returning to their homes in the hills. Xu Xi has successfully combined traditional Chinese mediums and brush techniques with Western elements. Intense fluorescent light streams from food booths and residence windows, casting yellow shadows, which is an effect not found in classical Chinese ink paintings.

Kanzan (Chinese: Hanshan) was a eccentric poet of the Tang dynasty (618-906) who befriended Jittoku (Chinese: Shide), a kitchen helper at a mountain temple. They both lived on leftover food from the temple's kitchen. As in these paintings, Kanzan is usually depicted holding a scroll, perhaps of his poetry or of Taoist wisdom; Jittoku holds a kitchen broom. Both have slightly unkempt appearances and carefree, laughing expressions. Zen, a meditative school of Buddhism, originated in India and was transmitted to Japan through China in the late twelfth century. In the Muromachi period, when these paintings were made, the happy-go-lucky figures of Kanzan and Jittoku were sometimes regarded among Zen practitioners as incarnations of the bodhisattvas Manjushri (Japanese: Monju) and Samantabadhra (Japanese: Fugen). The artist Tobai is believed to have been an ink painter from present-day Fukuoka prefecture who studied with Sesshu (1420-approx. 1506). The brushwork on the garments and broom are in the style of Sesshu. Some scholars have argued that Tobai was instead a painter of the Unkoku school active in the late 1500s or early 1600s. In either case, surviving works by this artist are rare.

In 1949 he began to receive training in the studio of Chao Shao-an, a master of the Lingnan school that defined the southern Chinese painting tradition of the modern time. In 1975 he moved to Virginia where he continued to paint, and there he achieved international recognition for his vivid images and beautiful colors typical of the Lingnan tradition.","Bingsun year (1956), 7th month.

,,approx. 1300-1050 BCE,,,,,On view,images_china/asian_china2613.jpg,,"The Evolution of Bronze Shapes and Designs Changes in the design and decoration of early Bronze Age vessels can be seen as a series of experiments with the new material of bronze and the new technology of casting. The earliest Chinese metal vessels were created by hammering bronze into the desired shapes. The bodies of these vessels tend to be thin and their profiles exaggerated versions of earlier ceramic vessels. Later, artisans developed the technology to cast vessels by pouring the molten metal into molds. The earliest bronze vessels probably borrowed their shapes from ceramic prototypes of the late Neolithic period. Due to the nature of the material, most ceramic forms had thick bodies, rounded profiles, and few, if any, surface protrusions. This influence can be seen in the legs and overall profile of the bronze. Changes in bronze vessel forms from these rather awkward beginnings indicate their creators’ growing familiarity with the unique characteristics of the clay-mold casting process. While surface decoration became quite complex, most bronze forms remained relatively simple—either curved or square—to facilitate the release of the mold pieces. Three-dimensional additions, such as elaborate handles or functional parts of vessels, were often precast and attached to the body by one of two complicated processes.",,Shang dynasty (approx. 1600-1050 BCE),Metal Arts,"H. 11 1/4 in x W. 9 1/2 in x D. 10 in, H. 28.6 cm x W. 24 cm x D. 25.4 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60B1021,Bronze,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/59659/preview,Ritual food vessel (you)

They introduce a set of new silhouettes, all characterized by a certain squatness and sagging of the contours, as well as a set of unprecedented ornamental schemes. Two of these motifs are particularly conspicuous and are typical of the period, namely the overlapping rows of flattened scales (smaller hu, dou and you ) and the wave band with stylized animal shapes (tall hu and you ). The latter motif illustrates a more advanced stage in the calligraphic trend mentioned in connection with the preceding plate. The scale motifs which cover the larger part of the lid and the body of the sagging you (front right, B60B146) stand in flat relief against a background of fine raised lines. So does the wave band with heart shapes on the neck. A reduced, simplified version of this band appears at the base of the larger tubular knob of the lid. The outer sides of the ""ears"" of the lid are incised with barbed spirals. The top of the slender but wide bow handle is divided into four sections by small ridges. Each section contains a long-tailed' crested bird. Both ends of the handle sport disproportionately large ovine heads with curled horns. Similar heads in reduced scales appear in axial position on the neck band. Somehow the birds of the handle and these heads seem to be out of style because they are the only zoomorphic elements in a geometrical context. It is with such vessels that one appreciates the full value of the drastic changes that occurred during the middle Western Zhou period.

These new patrons created a demand for luxury items in bronze, jade, lacquer, textile, and other materials. Items of personal adornment in bronze, which had been rare in earlier periods, were created in great numbers. Many were small in scale, elegant, and superbly crafted. Gilding, inlaying, and other decorative techniques also became more common and many items featured inlays of gold, silver, jade, and precious stones. All of these qualities are found in belt hooks, which were used to hang small objects or fasten elaborate belts around loose-fitting embroidered silk robes. From the objects in this case you will see that bronze, iron, and jade served as bases for these belt hooks. Iron corrodes much more easily than bronze, and few iron pieces have survived from this early period.",,,Metal Arts,"H. 5 1/4 in x W. 3/4 in x D. 4 1/2 in, H. 13.3 cm x W. 1.9 cm x D. 11.4 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B65B44,"Bronze with inlaid gold, silver, and stone",China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/22167/preview,Belt hook

Unlike ceramic bowls, whose rounded lips either tapered or were bound with metal, these jade versions are punctuated by a beveled edge, which highlights the artisan's control over the hard stone. As is typical for covered bowls of this type, the shallow lid sits inside the flared lip of the deeper bowl and is itself surmounted by a small foot ring so that it too may be used as a bowl when inverted. Like their porcelain prototypes, these vessels have thin sides that exploit the translucence of the material. This commonality between jade and porcelain may help explain the popularity of jade skeuomorphs (decorative versions) of porcelain pieces that began to appear in the eighteenth century once jade supplies were plentiful enough to support the production of vessels.

Certain ancient types among Song official productions (960 –1279) were continuously copied. Ming official factories never stopped experimenting with varieties of new glazes, strains, and decorative devices to maintain porcelain's dominance over other ceremonial materials. A group of tablewares from the Avery Brundage collection illustrates four types of monochrome glazes produced in the Ming imperial factories in Jingdezhen from the early fifteenth through the sixteenth centuries. The Yongle emperor chose the color white and Islamic metalwork–inspired forms to be used at altars and imperial temples. The fifteenth-century white glaze, soupy and smooth, is knownas ""sweet white."" The dark blue glaze, favored by earlier Mongol rulers, was successfully reproduced during the Xuande period. Blue was often used in ritual celebrations on sacrificial altars. Eloquent names, such as ""gemstone blue"" and ""celestial blue,"" were documented. Yellow, viewed as a noble color, became fashionable in the late fifteenth century. This low-fire glaze could cover a previously fired white glaze for refiring, or coat a clay body for only one firing. The yellow wares presented to the Chenghua and Zhengde courts exhibit a delicate body and refined texture with sensitive color tone, winning the admirable description ""chicken fat."" The brown glaze resulted from an experiment in the Xuande reign, when official porcelain manufacturers attempted to re-create the brown glaze of a type of ancient Ding ware that had once been presented to the Northern Song court. On Ming imperial porcelain, brown glaze that glimmered on the surface with a shiny metallic luster was called ""purple gold,"" after the description for brown Song Ding ware. Matte brown glaze was referred to as ""soybean paste.""",,"Ming dynasty (1368-1644), Reign of the Jiajing emperor (1522-1566)",Ceramics,"H. 2 5/8 in x Diam. 5 1/4 in, H. 6.7 cm x Diam. 13.5 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60P1760,Porcelain with brown glaze,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/17835/preview,Bowl with brown glaze

These practices lost some of their importance with the breakdown of the Zhou government and ritual system. The subsequent social changes corresponded with the beginnings of the use of iron and other changes in technology, and resulted in an increase of wealth among a much broader segment of the population. These new patrons created a demand for luxury items in bronze, jade, lacquer, textile, and other materials. Items of personal adornment in bronze, which had been rare in earlier periods, were created in great numbers. Many were small in scale, elegant, and superbly crafted. Gilding, inlaying, and other decorative techniques also became more common and many items featured inlays of gold, silver, jade, and precious stones. All of these qualities are found in belt hooks, which were used to hang small objects or fasten elaborate belts around loose-fitting embroidered silk robes. From the objects in this case you will see that bronze, iron, and jade served as bases for these belt hooks.

Each face bears C-shaped designs in shallow relief. Both side edges are cut by three C-shaped indents. The term le in the first dictionary, Shuowen Jieji, was classified to the secondary stone to jade. The two tubular beads with central holes illustrated in Wu Dazheng's 1889 catalogue of jade were annotated as round le, serving as pommels on the handles of whips (Teng 1992a , 146). Na Zhiliang (1982, 211, no. 1478) thought that jade le were adaptations of a type of bone ornament. Different forms—straight cylindrical beads, tubular beads with two flaring ends, or plaques with tapering ends (an oblate shape) and a central hole—are all identified as le in modern archaeology. The earliest was the cylindrical form, which has been commonly found in Neolithic sites. Tubular beads with flaring ends have come from Shang and Zhou sites, emerging from archaeological excavations of Eastern Zhou tombs (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 3, plates 105–7). The type shown here, with a rectangular front view and an oblate profile, was usually decorated with shallow relief on front and back faces and indents on side edges. The hole identifies it as an ornament that was fastened to something else. This piece is a Qing reproduction of an Eastern Zhou style. Under a microscope, the surface clearly reveals artificially created spots filled with residue. The rough inner walls of these penetrations suggest manual tool work.

Particular flowers or combinations of birds and flowers were often chosen less for their intrinsic beauty than for their symbolic meaning. As a result, Ming and Qing artisans became successful in blending decorative motifs from multiple sources into a consistent, cohesive visual language. This language— utilizing birds, flowers, plants, and landscapes together with color symbolism—continued to evolve and expand during the Qing dynasty, reaching a pinnacle in the 1700s. Technological developments made possible the large variety of sizes, shapes, and decorative techniques of the objects in this case.

Certain ancient types among Song official productions (960 –1279) were continuously copied. Ming official factories never stopped experimenting with varieties of new glazes, strains, and decorative devices to maintain porcelain's dominance over other ceremonial materials. A group of tablewares from the Avery Brundage collection illustrates four types of monochrome glazes produced in the Ming imperial factories in Jingdezhen from the early fifteenth through the sixteenth centuries. The Yongle emperor chose the color white and Islamic metalwork– inspired forms to be used at altars and imperial temples. The fifteenth-century white glaze, soupy and smooth, is known as ""sweet white."" The dark blue glaze, favored by earlier Mongol rulers, was successfully reproduced during the Xuande period. Blue was often used in ritual celebrations on sacrificial altars. Eloquent names, such as ""gemstone blue"" and ""celestial blue,"" were documented. Yellow, viewed as a noble color, became fashionable in the late fifteenth century. This low-fire glaze could cover a previously fired white glaze for refiring, or coat a clay body for only one firing. The yellow wares presented to the Chenghua and Zhengde courts exhibit a delicate body and refined texture with sensitive color tone, winning the admirable description ""chicken fat."" The brown glaze resulted from an experiment in the Xuande reign, when official porcelain manufacturers attempted to re-create the brown glaze of a type of ancient Ding ware that had once been presented to the Northern Song court. On Ming imperial porcelain, brown glaze that glimmered on the surface with a shiny metallic luster was called ""purple gold,"" after the description for brown Song Ding ware. Matte brown glaze was referred to as ""soybean paste.""",,"Ming dynasty (1368-1644), Reign of the Jiajing emperor (1522-1566)",Ceramics,"H. 1 5/8 in x Diam. 8 1/4 in, H. 4.2 cm x Diam. 21 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60P2087,Porcelain with blue glaze,"Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China",Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/18678/preview,Plate with blue glaze

Surviving paintings, architecture, and sculpture made of perishable materials are rare, but some traces can be found in Japan, where more artwork and structures of the same period have survived. Small-scale gilded bronze objects also allow valuable insight into the magnificence of this sculptural tradition. Although there is no inscribed identification, the Buddha of the altar set is probably Amitābha, judging from his mudra and gesture. However, the iconography of the two accompanying bodhisattvas (the moon and sun discs in their respective hands) suggests that the central deity would be Bhaiṣajyaguru, the ""Healing Buddha"".

,,1800s,,,,,Not on view,images_china/asian_china2828.jpg,,"A rocky isle rises steeply from the ocean, with waves frothing at its base. Liu Hai, Immortal and God of Wealth, is seen on a rocky ledge. He is seated with one leg folded beneath him and his hand resting on his raised right knee, a pose more closely associated with Guanyin, the Buddhist Lord of Mercy. His attribute, the string of cash, is hung around his neck. This is what he uses to tease his toad, which likes to disappear once in a while. Liu Hai looks benignly at his three-legged toad, which appears on the ledge below. The warty toad turns to his master, billowing clouds from its mouth. Above Liu Hai is a two-story pavilion built below a towering crag incised with a pair of flying bats, a symbol of blessings. A tall pine tree on the right balances the composition; its bark and pine needles are clearly defined. A small tree with rounded leaves grows along the crevices, as do other small plants. A wall and gateway appear in the back, and trees grow precariously among the rocks. Soapstone is a much softer material than jade, and lends itself to delicate carving. This is a fine piece of sculpture with remarkable attention to details. The pine needles are unusual—they do not follow the traditional motif used by jade craft workers in the 1700s and 1800s. Instead of an oval with lines radiating from the center, the pine needles appear in fan-shaped clusters with lines radiating from the bottom, the way they would have appeared in a painting.",,Qing dynasty (1644-1911),Jade And Stones,"H. 7 1/2 in x W. 6 3/4 in x D. 4  1/4 in, H. 19.0 cm x W. 17.1 cm x D. 10.8 cm",Transfer from the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco,,B81J2,Soapstone,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/28175/preview,Mystic isle

The design on this piece is typical of archaeological finds from tombs in Guangdong, Liaoning, and Jiangsu provinces, dating from the Spring and Autumn Period (770–481 bce) of the Eastern Zhou to the Eastern Han period (25–220 ce). The stud on early examples was close to the end opposite the dragon's head, but in later pieces it gradually moved toward the center of the handle (Wang 1985, 284, figs. 12, 15–18). The dragons' heads on early jades always looked back 180 degrees, but from the Eastern Zhou period (770–256 bce) they began turning at angles between 180 and 90 degrees.

The glazes were applied with little apparent regard for the natural coloration of the animal or object depicted, and sancai wares are among the few examples in Chinese ceramics that have the appearance of spontaneity. However, this appearance can be deceiving, as a range of devices, including the application of resists and the incising of patterns on the surface, were sometimes used to control the flow of the glaze.

The popular imagery of fish swimming amongst the lotus expresses the desire for abundance. A common theme includes a pond teeming with fish to represent the desire for wealth and success. A fish's head is considered especially auspicious. It is always a delicacy at a New Year's banquet because fish head (yú tóu) can also be interpreted as ""the beginning of wealth."" Families also eat fish during New Year's celebrations to ensure that they will have an abundance of good wishes in the coming months. HIDDEN MEANING: May your household be filled with gold and jade; or May you have a prosperous household (jinyu mantang). This European export piece is for cooling wine and holding drinking glasses, but the Chinese artisans had no idea of its intended use.

The bottom is now usually rounded, the sides straight or convex, the uprights frequently have semicircular or round columns and caps that can assume a variety of shapes, including those of cones, domes or inverted beakers. Of all the exceptional features displayed by our third jue (left, B60B1049), the most spectacular may well be its ox-headed lid. The knob of the lid is a plain tube. Its top is decorated with two addorsed gaping and taloned dragons with bottle-shaped horns on the "" neck,"" immediately behind the head, and, on the ""tail'' with blades of confronted dragons that are taloned; gaping and ascending. Under the spout is a ""dragonized"" cicada and under the tail a rising blade with two confronted, taloned and descending dragons. On the neck, between spout and tail, five small rising blades contain stylized animal shapes. Curiously enough, there are not one, but two tiers of decoration on the body, the main zone being separated from the neck by a narrow ribbon with I and T-shaped scores. The main zone consists of four taloned and crested dragons confronted two by two and framed by the handle on one side and on the other three sides by triangular flanges with incised chevron patterns; another unusual feature. The outside of the legs are incised with elongated hanging blades comprising stylized animal shapes. The caps of the uprights are in the shape of coiled, scaled dragons with their heads in the round. The upper part of the bow-shaped handle has a bovine head also in the round, and echoing that of the lid. The space behind the handle, usually reserved for an inscription, is here tilled by a large incised cicada. The vessel bears two identical, nine-graph inscriptions, one cast inside the lid, the other one on the inside wall of the body. The first graph of this inscription is ( zi for ""son(s)"").

The earliest Chinese metal vessels were created by hammering bronze into the desired shapes. The bodies of these vessels tend to be thin and their profiles exaggerated versions of earlier ceramic vessels. Later, artisans developed the technology to cast vessels by pouring the molten metal into molds. The earliest bronze vessels probably borrowed their shapes from ceramic prototypes of the late Neolithic period. Due to the nature of the material, most ceramic forms had thick bodies, rounded profiles, and few, if any, surface protrusions. This influence can be seen in the legs and overall profile of the bronze. Changes in bronze vessel forms from these rather awkward beginnings indicate their creators’ growing familiarity with the unique characteristics of the clay-mold casting process. While surface decoration became quite complex, most bronze forms remained relatively simple—either curved or square—to facilitate the release of the mold pieces. Three-dimensional additions, such as elaborate handles or functional parts of vessels, were often precast and attached to the body by one of two complicated processes.",,Shang dynasty (approx. 1600-1050 BCE),Metal Arts,"H. 13 in x W. 8 in x D. 7 1/2 in, H. 33 cm x W. 20.3 cm x D. 19.1 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60B45,Bronze,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/11517/preview,Ritual wine vessel (jia)

The range of decorative motifs found on gong vessels is particularly broad as it includes quadrupeds, reptiles, birds, and even at times human elements. Such wealth and variety seem to reflect an attempt to produce a syncretic vessel illustrating all the main aspects of the Shang pantheon. Simultaneously, this whole category of vessels is dominated by a type of association quite unique in Shang art: that of a horned quadruped and an owl-like bird standing on fairly equal terms. More streamlined and better integrated than the two previous specimens [B60B1032 and B60B1004], the third gong illustrated here (bottom right, B60B976) is also more convincingly zoomorphic.

The glazes were applied with little apparent regard for the natural coloration of the animal or object depicted, and sancai wares are among the few examples in Chinese ceramics that have the appearance of spontaneity. However, this appearance can be deceiving, as a range of devices, including the application of resists and the incising of patterns on the surface, were sometimes used to control the flow of the glaze.

As a result, his brushwork is generally characterized by bold sweeping strokes with rough edges and ""flying white"" dryness (see detail). After the Rain is a poem that describes the birds happily singing in the wind among flowers outside the window right after the rain stopped.

The artist coordinates small figures into a vast picturesque composition, transforming rustic life into a poetic scene of nature. Rustic villages are cradled by mountains, or built out over the water. A narrative picture unfolds from the left: in a thatched house mid-mountain, a group of three women gather to sew clothes and make yarn. At the center of the picture, two fishermen stand on the riverbank; one, with a woven-cord ladder, lifts a large, tied-up fishnet out of the water, and behind him, a young man casts a small net. Up toward the middle reaches of the river, a gentleman sits on a boat, accompanied by a young man in front of him, while a boatman at the stern pulls the oars. There is a clear contrast between the flat water and high cliffs, between crisp, sharp brushwork and soft washes and strokes. The deep perspective, the use of axe-shaped strokes for rock textures, and the subdued colors of foliage are derived from the major artistic innovations developed during the Song dynasty (960–1279).",,Yuan dynasty (1271-1368),Painting,"H. 78 1/8 in x W. 45 3/4 in, H. 198.4 cm x W. 115.3 cm (image); H. 122 3/8 in x W. 47 3/8 in, H. 310.8 cm x W. 120.3 cm (overall)",Museum purchase,,B69D13,Ink and colors on silk,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/63417/preview,Life in Mountain Villages

At the end of the river, he finds a narrow cave leading him into a utopian village, entirely isolated from the cares of the world. When the fisherman leaves, he is never able to find the village again. The artist alludes to this story through exquisite pink-hued trees and a grotto-like tunnel in the lower right. From this tunnel, a road leads the viewer past fanciful, tilting peaks to a tranquil setting of farmhouses and rice fields. The artist of this otherworldly vision, Tokuyama Gyokuran, was a rare female artist working in a man’s world in eighteenth-century Japan.

There were three main categories: vessels for food, vessels for wine, and (in far fewer numbers) vessels for water. The most common food appears to have been a stew or gruel, and food vessels often had bowl-like bodies. The food was removed from the vessel with a ladle. Wine was served warm, and many wine vessels had relatively long legs so they could be placed over a fire. Spouts were also required for pouring the wine into cups. The awkward relationship between the usual three legs and two spouts was one of the challenges for the designers of these vessels. Water was apparently used for ritual cleansing, and most water vessels had relatively flat bottoms and low rims.","The spout is incised with four rising blades containing nondescript animal shapes and also with a band of barbed spirals.

The earliest Chinese metal vessels were created by hammering bronze into the desired shapes. The bodies of these vessels tend to be thin and their profiles exaggerated versions of earlier ceramic vessels. Later, artisans developed the technology to cast vessels by pouring the molten metal into molds. The earliest bronze vessels probably borrowed their shapes from ceramic prototypes of the late Neolithic period. Due to the nature of the material, most ceramic forms had thick bodies, rounded profiles, and few, if any, surface protrusions. This influence can be seen in the legs and overall profile of the bronze. Changes in bronze vessel forms from these rather awkward beginnings indicate their creators’ growing familiarity with the unique characteristics of the clay-mold casting process. While surface decoration became quite complex, most bronze forms remained relatively simple—either curved or square—to facilitate the release of the mold pieces. Three-dimensional additions, such as elaborate handles or functional parts of vessels, were often precast and attached to the body by one of two complicated processes.",The three-character inscription cast inside the vessel and lid reads X fu yi 끱父乙. 1/19/2017 He Li,Shang dynasty (approx. 1600-1050 BCE),Metal Arts,"H. 11 1/2 in x W. 7 1/2 in x D. 6 1/8 in, H. 29.8 cm x W. 17.8 cm x D. 15.6 cm",The Avery Brundage Collection,,B60B767.a-.b,Bronze,China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/51328/preview,Ritual vessel (fangyi) with lid

Many of these designs consist of composite or wholly imaginary animals. On bronze vessels of the Shang dynasty, the most frequently seen of these animals is the taotie, a composite dragon-like animal whose body has been split down the middle and splayed out on both sides of the head. The head of the taotie has large eyes, horns, and a gaping mouth; the body at times has only one pair of legs. As the gong illustrates, in later periods of the Shang dynasty the taotie was joined by a wide range of dragons, birds, and other animals, both real and imaginary. What meaning did the taotie have? Some scholars believe that it evolved from decorative patterns and had no real meanings. Others argue that a motif as prominent as the taotie must have been central to the culture’s world view.

The cover consists of a mushroom-shaped knob, a dome and a vertical rim. The knob is incised with a whorl-circle. The dome is divided into four sections by flanges with I and T-shaped scores. Two or these flanges serve as axes for four taloned, confronted dragons forming taotie masks. The vertical rim, which is equipped with two pointed tongues fitting in notches located on the mouth rim, is really treated as an upper neck band, as amply indicated by the presence of the sharp overhanging ridge that separates it from the dome. This vertical rim is divided into four panels by small, vertical ridges. Each panel contains a couple of bunked dragon; with heart-shaped ears. The body proper displays one main and three secondary zones of decoration. The neck belt contains four sections delineated by two axial animal heads in high relief and by the tenons of the handle. Each section is decorated with a regardant dragon whose single horn is bottle-shaped. The upper belly band is also divided into four panels by scored flanges with a single spur. Each panel comprises a couple of beaked dragons. The lower belly band, which is also the main zone of decoration. i, similarly partitioned by flanges with two spurs in the upper section. Four large taloned dragons are confronted two by two to form taotie masks with hilt-shaped shields.

Four sections, delineated by three lozenges in high relief and by the terminal animal heads in the round, display the same unusual motif that can be interpreted as a horned cicada.

They introduce a set of new silhouettes, all characterized by a certain squatness and sagging of the contours, as well as a set of unprecedented ornamental schemes. Two of these motifs are particularly conspicuous and are typical of the period, namely the overlapping rows of flattened scales (smaller hu, dou and you ) and the wave band with stylized animal shapes (tall hu and you ). The latter motif illustrates a more advanced stage in the calligraphic trend mentioned in connection with the preceding plate. In bronze the dou (B60B949) does not seem to have been in use prior to the 9th century BCE, even though this shape is found in pottery as early as the Neolithic period. The bowl of this rare vessel is very shallow. The vertical outer wall or the bowl is deeply recessed underneath, and this recession is perforated with four large rectangular openings which do not seem to have any functional value. On the outside of the bowl and below two incised parallel lines, eight big and dome-like whorl-circles alternate with eight geometrical patterns in low relief.

,,1400-1600,,,,,On view,images_china/asian_china3179.jpg,,"Vietnamese Ceramics In Vietnam, as in Thailand, ceramics were made both for domestic use and for export. Vietnamese potters had access to finer clays than their Thai counterparts, however, and, unlike the Thais, the Vietnamese made use of underglaze painting in cobalt to produce blue-andwhite ware. Chinese blue-and-white ceramics became so popular throughout Asia in the 1300s and 1400s that other countries, like Vietnam, began to produce similar wares to capture part of the market. The development and dating of such ceramics in Vietnam is as yet poorly understood. The only anchor point is a Vietnamese blue-and-white bottle in the former Turkish imperial collection inscribed with a date equivalent to 1450. In the early 1990s a sunken ship dating from about 1450–1500 was found off the Vietnamese coast near Hoi An. The ship carried more than 250,000 Vietnamese ceramic vessels, suggesting the huge scale of the trade in ceramics. Even though the shapes and decorative motifs of Vietnamese and Chinese blue-and-white wares are sometimes similar, certain features allow them to be distinguished from each other. First, Vietnamese blue-and-white is high-fired stoneware, not porcelain, as Chinese examples are. Next, the white of Vietnamese blue-and-white is usually not the crisp white of Chinese wares but a soft, creamy white.

The words thog (thunder and lightning) and lcags (iron) indicate that these metal objects are associated with specific atmospheric phenomena. The fact that togchas are found by chance by Tibetan peasants working in the fields or picked up by nomads in the highlands has led to the belief that they were not created by human hands but “fell from the sky” due to the effects of thunder and lightning. Tibetans wear togchas on their bodies and fondle them with their hands; some togchas develop a patina from constant handling. Togchas, although found in Tibet, are not necessarily Tibetan in origin. For example, no. 1 is a Chinese Tang-dynasty image of the Buddha Maitreya that probably came into Tibet with the first transmission of Buddhism, when the Tibetan king Tsongtsen Gampo married Buddhist princesses from China and Nepal.",,,Metal Arts,"H. 1 1/2 in x W. 1/4 in x D. 1/4 in, H. 3.8 cm x W. 0.6 cm x D. 0.6 cm",Gift of Vicki Shiba in memory of Her Brother Jonathan Kirk Shiba,,1994.8,Bronze,Tibet,Himalayan Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/2329/preview,Ritual dagger (purba)

Seated on a low platform chair, Yi Xing is depicted as a round-headed man with bright eyes and sturdy figure. Beneath his brown monk’s robe his hands are clasped before his chest. Esoteric Buddhism was transmitted to Japan by the Japanese monk Kukai (774–835), who had studied in China for two years. After his return to Japan in 806, he established the Shingon sect of Buddhism. Shingon literally means ""true word,"" meaning a sacred spell. Mystical rituals, gestures, and syllables as well as mandalas (sacred diagrams) were a key feature of Shingon Buddhism. These practices appealed to Japanese commoners who wanted to engage in a religious practice they believed would ward off evil. According to Shingon practice, Esoteric doctrine is transmitted directly from masters to initiated disciples, giving great significance to the ceremony of initiation ( kanjo ). Portraits of the eight early patriarchs of Esoteric Buddhism were hung on the walls of temples, and incense was burned before them. By this means, disciples were informed of the lineage of transmission. As Shingon developed, more sets of portraits of the patriarchs were created, based on a small number of originals. The painter of this work probably copied Yi Xing’s features from those in earlier portraits.",,,Painting,"H. 29 1/8 in x W. 21 1/8 in, H. 74.0 cm x W. 53.7 cm (image)",Gift of Helga and Phil Fleishman,Japanese,2001.17,Ink and colors on silk,Japan,Japanese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/73432/preview,The Monk Yi Xing

The square format of the mat and the radial arrangement of its motifs suggest ancient connections to Hindu and Buddhist sacred diagrams. The motifs seen here (solar disks, stylized boats, combs, roosters, and other birds) are also common on woven cloths of the region. Ceremonial mats would have been used at events of social and spiritual significance, and many of the motifs are symbols of transition. Such mats may have functioned as seats for the communities spiritual leaders on these important occasions. Decorated mats of this kind were sometimes paired with a small ceremonial cloth (tampan). These two important items of regalia were stored together in ancestral temples.

Debate surrounds many famous works in important collections around the world. In fact these debates were often part of the entertainment at Elegant Gatherings, during which diverse opinions might be freely shared. Works like this handscroll would be perfect subjects for such debates. This work bears the characters for the signature of Qian Xuan, a famous Yuan dynasty (1279–1368) painter of flower-and-bird subjects. It is the opinion of many experts, however, that the piece must have been made later. The sumptuous colors of the fruits and the exquisite brushwork combining clear outlines with colored vegetable and mineral dyes derive from techniques which began to be practiced at the imperial court during the 900s. Qian Xuan, whose name appears on this version, specialized in this technique. Although the scroll bears the signature of Qian Xuan and contains three colophons by artists living during the 1300s, based on its dramatic presentation of the subject and its rich colors, it is most likely a copy dating from the late Ming or early Qing dynasty.

The piece of silk Fu chose for this hanging scroll was too long to fit on the top of his painting table; it was necessary for him to begin at the top of the cloth and then move the silk away from him as he continued toward the bottom, an action he had to repeat for each line of characters. There is, however, no noticeable break in the flow of the characters. The brush flies along the silk, turning, twisting, and on occasion grinding into the surface. The large characters are written with a great deal of power. The overall effect is raw and expressive, all the more surprising considering the qualities of the silk. Fu Shan's artistic expertise, along with his anti-Manchu political orientation, won him popularity in Chinese intellectual circles both during and after his time. Members of the Yeh family were among the many who revered him.

The shorter one is a square-faceted column with a flat bottom. At the top sits a high-relief lion above a meander encircling the column. Shallow-relief scenes with calligraphy titles decorate the sides: willows on a riverbank, entitled ""waves by green willows,"" and blown willows, described as ""by the river,"" on two sides; the pleasure of a fisherman, accompanied by the title ""small boat,"" and a ""fishhook"" on the other two sides. All the calligraphy is rendered in raised characters, but the background around them is coarsely executed and not very flat. The simple, strong grooves display an early style. This piece can be used as both a hairpin and a personal seal. A Ming tomb in Shanghai contained similar jade hairpins in white jade, with the seal of a lion in relief above a meander circle (Zgyqqj 1993, vol. 5, plate 220).

Strong curved cuts define a scene of a dragonet (young dragon) amid fungi on the surface and the domed top, under which two characters spell Zigang in raised cursive script. Lu Zigang (late 1500s) probably came from Taicang county in Jiangsu province and settled in the jade craft center at Suzhou. He was well known in the late Ming as a great jade master, and his work has been widely reproduced. The local annals of Suzhou and Taicang (compiled between 1800 and 1900) record that Lu made jade hairpins with two designs: narcissus plants whose stems were as delicate and refined as human hair; and raised calligraphy containing more than one character on each piece. Only one hairpin, from the National Palace Museum, Taipei, has been published as a documented narcissus pin (Teng 1981, 77, plate 10).

The pronounced honeycomb molding on this pitcher recalls the turquoise-glazed jug B60P1927. Both vessels were inspired by metalwork prototypes with hammered surfaces and knobbed handles. Bird-headed pitchers appear in Persian poetry, and they enjoyed a well-traveled history. Early Persian examples in silver from the Sasanian era (224-651) arrived in China where they were emulated in pottery and porcelain during the Tang (618-906) and Song (960-1279) periods. Chinese versions, known as phoenix-headed pitchers due to the alteration of their shape and symbolism, reached West Asia in the tenth century. Islamic potters mimicked the Chinese pitchers with an opaque white glazed ware. Later, a variety of decorative techniques were used, demonstrating the versatility of the medieval Persian potter working with fritware.

Robust and elegant, shapes are almost classical in their rotundity, simplicity and directness. Perfectly adapted to these shapes, the ebullient decor, tempered by strict symmetry consists essentially of uninterrupted circular bands of more or less abstracted animal shapes in low relief and filled with granulated or thread-like details, the latter being usually variants of the round-and-triangular volute. Liyu style ding vary greatly in proportions and iconography. This series comprises some of the smallest and largest vessels ever produced by Chinese bronze casters. The surface decoration of the diminutive ding (B60B5+) consists of a circle on top of the cover and of four concentric bands of regardant and legless dragons. Starting from the top, the first and third bands utilize the same pattern of boldly, intertwined dragons with elongated lolling tongues and bifurcated tails. The dragons of the second and fourth bands have short tongues and form a continuous frieze in the sense that the tail or each dragon merges into the crest of the following one, without any obvious transition. The third and fourth bands are separated by a twisted rope in high relief. The circle on top of the cover is inscribed with a whorl pattern made of triangular and round volutes. The handles are also incised with geometric designs. The cabriole legs bear animal masks in high relief and the three bovines in the round that adorn the cover are reminiscent of those of the ding of Pl.

Surviving paintings, architecture, and sculpture made of perishable materials are rare, but some traces can be found in Japan, where more artwork and structures of the same period have survived. Small-scale gilded bronze objects also allow valuable insight into the magnificence of this sculptural tradition.

Chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra lists his thirty-three forms and relates his ability to rescue believers from peril.

Most of these early examples are either green or yellow. Over the following centuries, Chinese potters experimented with lead-based glazes and added blue, white, and a number of other colors to their palette. At the peak of their development in the Tang dynasty, glazes were made in five or six colors. These colorful Tang-dynasty ceramics are known in Chinese as sancai, or three-color wares. The glazes were applied with little apparent regard for the natural coloration of the animal or object depicted, and sancai wares are among the few examples in Chinese ceramics that have the appearance of spontaneity.

These practices lost some of their importance with the breakdown of the Zhou government and ritual system. The subsequent social changes corresponded with the beginnings of the use of iron and other changes in technology, and resulted in an increase of wealth among a much broader segment of the population. These new patrons created a demand for luxury items in bronze, jade, lacquer, textile, and other materials. Items of personal adornment in bronze, which had been rare in earlier periods, were created in great numbers. Many were small in scale, elegant, and superbly crafted. Gilding, inlaying, and other decorative techniques also became more common and many items featured inlays of gold, silver, jade, and precious stones. All of these qualities are found in belt hooks, which were used to hang small objects or fasten elaborate belts around loose-fitting embroidered silk robes.

The drill marks indicate it was cut from the top. In use, a series of these jade silkworms would have dangled from the main pendant cord; attached only by the small suspension hole located at the very top, they would have swung quite freely. The depiction of an insect larva in the rare and treasured material of jade might come as a surprise. However, this larva produces silk, and silk, along with jade, has long been among the most treasured of materials to the Chinese.

Keeping track of who is who is a challenge even for the most dedicated fan. Most popular print depictions of Chinese opera fall into one of two categories: either showing the actors in full stage costume in a landscape or architectural setting or as they would appear on a stage traditionally set with minimal props. As the popularity of the theater grew beginning in the early 1800s, production of theatrical prints also surged. Popular prints became an important part of folk tradition nearly a thousand years ago, and they remain so today. These prints are used for residential decoration and viewing pleasure, and can be purchased throughout the year. Varied in subject, color, and format, the prints are often glued on doors, windows, walls, pillars, furniture, and any place outdoors around the house. Celebratory themes and images pictured on the prints bear wishes for a happy New Year, a long life, health, fortune, continuation of the family line, and protections against evil-many of the prominent themes embedded in symbols on Chinese art. Popular prints were made either using woodblock printing or using offset lithography, a technique that largely replaced woodblock printing from the early twentieth century onward. Derived from lithography, the offset process involves three cylinders: 1. The artist creates the image on the plate cylinder as he or she would like it to appear in print (that is, a positive image). 2. The image is transferred to the rubber offset cylinder as a negative. 3. Paper is fed between the offset cylinder and the impression cylinder, which presses the image onto the paper and results in a positive print.",,,Prints And Drawings,Image: H. 17 1/8 in × W. 22 3/8 in (43.5 cm × 56.8 cm) Overall: H. 13 3/8 in × W. 19 7/16 in (34 cm × 49.4 cm),Bequest of John Gutmann,,2010.189,"Offset lithograph, ink and colors on paper",China,Chinese Art,https://searchcollection.asianart.org/internal/media/dispatcher/9965/preview,Scene from The Water Margin

This print won the Silver Award at the 2007 Guizhou Provincial Art Exhibition in Guiyang, China. Born into a peasant family of the Tujia ethnicity in the small town of Sinan, Guizhou province, Zhang Qingxue dreamed of becoming a painter from childhood. While recovering from a severe attack of polio that caused him physical deformity, the teenage Zhang often spent as much as fifteen hours a day sketching and sculpting.

,,,,Warring States period (approx. 475-221 BCE),,,Not on view,images_china/asian_china3440.jpg,,"This sword pommel has a slightly beveled ridge around its outer edge. A field of raised comma spirals defined by incised lines fills the exterior region, and the grid used by the carver to arrange the whorls is slightly visible. This ""sprouting grain"" pattern is the culmination of the development of textured surfaces that began with the incised dragon's head pattern. A smooth, plain border gently slopes upward and separates off the central face, which is decorated with a cloud motif consisting of three grooves, secondary incised lines and three areas of fine cross-hatching. The surface is carefully worked and finely finished. This was the standard central design on most sword pommels. Others were decorated with a four or five open petal pattern in relief or were covered by high relief dragons. The back of this piece is plain except for a circular groove. It shows the precision and workmanship characteristic of jades from the Warring States period, demonstrating the refinement of jade working techniques from earlier times. It is highly finished with a combination of order and fluidity. Sword fittings were abundant during the Warring States period because of the breakdown of central authority and the increase in political turmoil. The sword pommel was attached perpendicularly to the upper end of the sword handle. It is one of four jade military pieces for the sword -- pommel, slide, chape, and guard. Several pommels were found in the tomb of the Nanyue King in Guangzhou. The central designs on these differ, suggesting the path of development of the decor in later times. The surface of this piece has been almost totally altered by burial or other means. It is now a warm ivory with areas of light tan. Due to the opacity of the surface it is difficult to determine the quality of the stone. The level of finish is quite high, as is the polish. 1. Forsyth, plate 124 2. Rawson, 21:3 3. Fung, p. 199 4.
